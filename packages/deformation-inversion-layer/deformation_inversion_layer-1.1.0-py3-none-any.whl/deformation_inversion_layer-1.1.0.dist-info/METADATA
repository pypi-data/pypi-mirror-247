# Deformation inversion layer

*Deformation inversion layer* is a neural network layer for inverting deformation fields develped as part of SITReg, a deep learning intra-modality image registration arhitecture fulfilling strict symmetry properties.

## Installation

Install using pip by running the command

    pip install deformation-inversion-layer

## Requirements

- `Python 3.6+`
- `PyTorch 1.10+`

## Source code

Code repository can be found at GitHub [https://github.com/honkamj/deformation-inversion-layer](https://github.com/honkamj/deformation-inversion-layer)

## Documentation

For documentation, see the GitHub repository.

## Publication

If you use deformation inversion layer, please cite the SITReg paper. Details for citing can be found at the GitHub repository.

## Acknowledgments

[Tutorial](http://implicit-layers-tutorial.org/) by Zico Kolter, David Duvenaud, and Matt Johnson was very helpful in implementing the layer.
