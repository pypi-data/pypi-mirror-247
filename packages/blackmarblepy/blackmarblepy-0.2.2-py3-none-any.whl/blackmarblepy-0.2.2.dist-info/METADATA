**BlackMarblePy** is a Python package that provides a simple way to use nighttime lights data from NASA's Black Marble project. [Black Marble](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov) is a [NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov) project that provides a product suite of daily, monthly and yearly global [nighttime lights](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/nighttime-lights). This package automates the process of downloading all relevant tiles from the [NASA LAADS DAAC](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs/laads) to cover a region of interest, converting the raw files (in HDF5 format), to georeferenced rasters, and mosaicing rasters together when needed.

## Features

- Download daily, monthly, and yearly nighttime lights data for user-specified region of interest and time.
- Parallel downloading for faster data retrieval and automatic retry mechanism for handling network errors.
- Access NASA Black Marble as a Xarray Dataset
  - Integrated data visualization with customization options
    - Choose between various plot types, including bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
    - Customize plot appearance with color palettes, axes labels, titles, and legends.
    - Save visualizations as high-resolution images for presentations or reports.
  - Perform time series analysis on nighttime lights data.
    - Calculate zonal statistics like mean and sum.
    - Plot time series of nighttime lights data.

## Installation

**BlackMarblePy** is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) as [blackmarblepy](https://pypi.org/project/blackmarblepy) and can installed using `pip`:

```shell
pip install blackmarblepy
```

## Usage

Before downloading and extracting Black Marble data, define the [NASA LAADS archive](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/5000/VNP46A3/) `bearer` token, and define a region of interest (i.e., `gdf` as a [`geopandas.GeoDataFrame`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html)).

```python
from blackmarble.raster import bm_raster

# Raster stack of daily data
date_range = pd.date_range("2022-01-01", "2022-03-31", freq="D")

# Retrieve VNP46A2 for date range into a Xarray Dataset
daily = bm_raster(
    gdf,
    product_id="VNP46A2",
    date_range=date_range,
    bearer=bearer,
)
```
