<h5 class="pt-4"><b>Data Extraction</b></h5>
<ul>
  <li>The data extraction follows <i>extraction rules</i> which can be configured below. These rules are applied
    consecutively in the defined order.
  </li>
  <li><b>Keep data:</b> For every field/column/variable that you want to
    keep in the donated data, you first have to define an extraction rule with the "Keep field" operator.
  </li>
  <li><b>Filter and alter data:</b> Next, you can add rules to filter (i.e., delete) or alter entries in the
    uploaded data
    (e.g., to delete all entries where the date is < 01.01.2020, or to replace
    e-mail-addresses with "ANONYMIZED EMAIL"). For this, there are several comparison and regex operations
    available.
  </li>
