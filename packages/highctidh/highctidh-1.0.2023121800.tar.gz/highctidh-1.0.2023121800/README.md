![highctidh build status](https://ci.codeberg.org/api/badges/vula/highctidh/status.svg "highctidh build status")

This is an unofficial fork of high-ctidh. This is highly experimental software
and it has not yet been reviewed for security considerations.

This fork enhances high-ctidh with additional Makefile targets including
building high-ctidh as four shared libraries, one for each key size of 511,
512, 1024, and 2048. Python bindings are additionally added, as well as
optional Debian packaging of both the shared library object files and the
Python module. The Python bindings were made in concert with the author of the
Golang bindings which are now included. Both bindings were built around the
same shared objects for cross verification purposes. Currently this library is
fast on the `x86_64` CPU architecture and functional but much slower with other
CPU architectures. The portable backend was generated using the `fiat-crypto`
project which uses a "Correct-by-Construction" approach; see `PRIMES.md` for
more information.  Tested architectures for the C library include: `amd64`,
`arm32/armv7l`, `arm64/aarch64`, `i386`, `loongarch64/Loongson`,
`mips64/mips64el`, `POWER8/ppc64`, `POWER9/ppc64le`, `riscv64`, `s390x`,
`sparc64`, and `x86_64` (with and without avx2).

The Golang bindings compile and should be functional on `amd64`,
`arm32/armv7l`, `arm64`, `i386`, `ppc64le`, `riscv64`, `s390x`, and `mips64`.
The `misc/test-golang-cross.sh` script runs tests on the host build
architecture and then attempts to cross-compile for each listed architecture.
Native builds for the Golang bindings should be functional on `loong64` and
`sparc64` but this is currently untested.

The Python bindings build and should be functional on `amd64`, `arm32/armv7l`,
`arm32/armv5`, `arm64`, `i386`, `ppc64le`, `riscv64`, `s390x`, and `mips64el`.

Debian packages and Python wheels that contain everything needed to use
`highctidh` build with the `make -f Makefile.packages packages` Makefile target
for `amd64`, `arm32/armv7l`, `arm32/armv5`, `arm64`, `i386`, `mips64el`,
`ppc64el`, `riscv64`, and `s390x`.

To see rough performance numbers, look at `BENCHMARKS.md`. We recommend using
gcc 10 or later as the compiler except on `arm32/armv5`, `arm32/armv7l`,
`i386`, and `mips64/mips64el` where we recommend clang 14.

The library has been tested on the following operating systems:
- Debian Bookworm (GNU libc)
- Alpine v.3.18 (musl libc)
- HardenedBSD (FreeBSD libc).

To build and install we recommend:
```
   sudo apt install gcc clang make
   make
   sudo make install
```

To build and install the shared library files using the
"Correct-by-Construction" fiat-crypto portable C backend:
```
    make libhighctidh.so HIGHCTIDH_PORTABLE=1
    sudo make install
```
The fiat-crypto portable C backend works on all platforms.

To build and install the shared library files using the original artisanal
`x86_64` assembler backend:
```
    make libhighctidh.so HIGHCTIDH_PORTABLE=0
    sudo make install
```
The original artisanal assembler backend works only on the `x86_64` platform.
It has been modified slightly for compatibility with LLVM-`as`/`clang`.
Hand written assembler contributions for other platforms are welcome.

By default `HIGHCTIDH_PORTABLE=1` is enabled for all platforms unless
the library is installed via the Python package, in which case optimized
implementations will be used where possible.

To test without installing run the `test` target:
```
   make test
```
An example C program that can use any of the
libhighctidh_{511,512,1024,2048}.so libraries is available in
`example-ctidh.c`. Use the `make examples` target to build `example-ctidh511`,
`example-ctidh512`, `example-ctidh1024`, and `example-ctidh2048` programs.

A basic Python benchmarking program `misc/highctidh-simple-benchmark.py` shows
general performance numbers. Python tests may be run with pytest and should be
functional without pytest assuming the library is installed. If the library
path includes the build directory as is done in `test.sh`, pytest or python
should be able to run the tests without installation. 

More information about the Python bindings including installation instructions
are available in the `README.python.md` file.

The Golang bindings behave as any normal Golang module/package.
