def search_target(username,timeout=60,sfw=False)
```

for k, v in result.items():
    print(f"{k}: {v}")

```

## Contributing
We would love to have you help us with the development of Sherlock. Each and every contribution is greatly valued!

Here are some things we would appreciate your help on:
- Addition of new site support Ã‚Â¹
- Bringing back site support of [sites that have been removed](removed_sites.md) in the past due to false positives

[1] Please look at the Wiki entry on [adding new sites](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/wiki/Adding-Sites-To-Sherlock)
to understand the issues.
