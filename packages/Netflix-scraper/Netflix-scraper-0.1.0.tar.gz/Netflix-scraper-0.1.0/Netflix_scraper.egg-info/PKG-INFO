# Netflix Scraper

[![Oxylabs promo code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129506779/250792357-8289e25e-9c36-4dc0-a5e2-2706db797bb5.png)](https://oxylabs.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=7&aff_id=877&url_id=112)

Netflix Scraper extracts public data from Netflix on any scale you need.
This quick tutorial will show you how to scrape Netflix with [<u>Oxylabs’
Scraper API</u>](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api).

## How it works

You can gather Netflix data by sending a request to our API and
including the Netflix URLs you want to scrape. Our service will send
back the HTML of any Netflix page.

### Python code example

This code sample makes a request to our service, which then renders
JavaScript via a headless browser and retrieves the HTML of a Netflix
page:

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint


# Structure payload.
payload = {
   'source': 'universal',
   'url': 'https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80057281',
   'render': 'html'
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD'), #Your credentials go here
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with results.
pprint(response.json())
```

Visit our
[<u>documentation</u>](https://developers.oxylabs.io/scraper-apis/web-scraper-api/all-domains)
for more information about payload parameters.

### Output sample

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
      ...
      </script></div>
</html>
",
      "created_at": "2023-05-18 12:23:06",
      "updated_at": "2023-05-18 12:23:25",
      "page": 1,
      "url": "https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80057281",
      "job_id": "7064938450625018881",
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```
