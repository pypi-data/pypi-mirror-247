# or
pip install --upgrade surepy
```

there is also a small cli available

## Library example

```python
import asyncio

from os import environ
from pprint import pprint
from typing import Dict, List

from surepy import Surepy
from surepy.entities import SurepyEntity
from surepy.entities.devices import SurepyDevice
from surepy.entities.pet import Pet


async def main():

    # # user/password authentication (gets a token in background)
    # surepy = Surepy(email=user, password=password)

    # token authentication (token supplied via SUREPY_TOKEN env var)
    token = environ.get("SUREPY_TOKEN")
    surepy = Surepy(auth_token=token)

    # list with all pets
    pets: List[Pet] = await surepy.get_pets()
    for pet in pets:
        print(f"\n\n{pet.name}: {pet.state} | {pet.location}\n")
        pprint(pet.raw_data())

    print(f"\n\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n")

    # all entities as id-indexed dict
    entities: Dict[int, SurepyEntity] = await surepy.get_entities()

    # list with alldevices
    devices: List[SurepyDevice] = await surepy.get_devices()
    for device in devices:
        print(f"{device.name = } | {device.serial = } | {device.battery_level = }")
        print(f"{device.type = } | {device.unique_id = } | {device.id = }")
        print(f"{entities[device.parent_id].full_name = } | {entities[device.parent_id] = }\n")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Naming confusion for *surepetcarebeta* users 🐾 🤪 🤦

Sorry for the bad naming and resulting confusion and chaos 🙄 To "fix" this, I **renamed *surepetcarebeta* to *sureha***.
