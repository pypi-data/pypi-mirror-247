# Overview

PyScreech is a toolbox for calculating useful performance metrics associated with audio recordings
such as Speech Transmission Index for Public Address Systems (STIPA), 
Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), and Word Error Rate (WER).

# Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to install the most recent package from PyPI using:
```bash
pip install pyscreech
```
The PyPI distribution does not come with the StipaV5_CEA.wav file, so 
that file needs to be obtained to perform STIPA evaluations. If you are 
installing from the repo (see below), the file is located in the `resources` directory.

If you would like to install from a local version of the repo, you can use:
```bash
pip install .
```

If you intend to develop on the code, its often useful to do:
```bash
pip install -e ."[developer]"
```

# Usage

### Example command line usage:

## Testing
Try to run 
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli STIPA resources/StipaV5_CEA.wav 
```
Or if you need to point to the `StipaV5_CEA.wav` explicitly, use
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli STIPA resources/StipaV5_CEA.wav -r path/to/StipaV5_CEA.wav
```
A STIPA score of 1.0 should be obtained when you compare the reference to itself.

To test a STOI score, run 
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli STOI <recording_filename> -r <reference_filename>
```

To test a WER, run 
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli WER <recording_filename> -r <reference_filename>
``` 

For more command line options, type
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli -h
```
All files are expected to be audio files. Any audio file that is readable by the SoundFile
module is accepted.
