# Overview

PyScreech is a toolbox for calculating useful performance metrics associated with audio recordings
such as Speech Transmission Index (STI).

# Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to install the most recent package from PyPI using:
```bash
pip install pyscreech
```

If you would like to install from a local version of the repo, you can use:
```bash
pip install .
```

If you intend to develop on the code, its often useful to do:
```bash
pip install -e ."[developer]"
```

# Usage

### Example usage:

## Testing
Try to run 
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli STIPA resources/StipaV5_CEA.wav
```
Or to test a STOI score, run 
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli STOI resources/StipaV5_CEA.wav
```

A STIPA score of 1.0 should be obtained. For more command line options, type
```bash
python -m pyscreech.cli -h
```
