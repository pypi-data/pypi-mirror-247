# SortPy

SortPy is a Python package providing a comprehensive suite of efficient sorting algorithms. Designed to offer developers a wide array of sorting techniques, SortPy simplifies the process of organizing data structures with its collection of well-implemented algorithms.

## Installation

You can install SortPy via pip:

```bash
pip install SortPy
```

## Usage

To utilize SortPy in your Python scripts, simply import the desired sorting algorithms:

```python
from SortPy import bubble_sort, insertion_sort, merge_sort, selection_sort, heap_sort, quick_sort

unsorted_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

# Sort using Bubble Sort
sorted_list = bubble_sort(unsorted_list)
print("Sorted using Bubble Sort:", sorted_list)

# Sort using Insertion Sort
sorted_list = insertion_sort(unsorted_list)
print("Sorted using Insertion Sort:", sorted_list)

# Use other sorting algorithms similarly
```

## Included Sorting Algorithms

SortPy includes the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort:** Iteratively sorts elements by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each element into its correct position.
- **Merge Sort:** Employs the divide-and-conquer strategy to recursively divide the list into smaller parts, sorts them, and merges them back in order.
- **Selection Sort:** Repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.
- **Heap Sort:** Utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements by constructing a heap and successively removing the maximum element.
- **Quick Sort:** Divides the list into smaller sublists based on a pivot element, and recursively sorts sublists around the chosen pivot.
