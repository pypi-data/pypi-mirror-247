    """A mypy protocol for a hardware controller.

    This class provides an protocol for the basic hardware controller class,
    with at least two implementations: one for the OT-2, and one for the
    OT-3. While the two classes have the same API, fundamental architectural
    decisions in the OT-2 hardware controller (specifically the data types used
    in the HardwareControl/backend split) make it unsuitable for the OT-3.

    This is a protocol rather than an ABC because of the use of wrapping adapters
    such as ThreadManager and SynchAdapter. Because those classes work via
    getattr, they can't inherit from an ABC that requires specific methods;
    however, they can satisfy protocols.
