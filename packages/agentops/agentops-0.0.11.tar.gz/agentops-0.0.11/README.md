# AgentOps 🕵️

AI agents suck. We’re fixing that.

Build your next agent with benchmarks, observability, and replay analytics. AgentOps is the toolkit for evaluating and developing robust and reliable AI agents.

AgentOps is still in closed alpha. You can sign up for an API key [here](https://forms.gle/mFAP4XEoaiKXb2Xh9).

## Quick Start ⌨️

```pip install agentops```

### Session replays in 3 lines of code
Initialize the AgentOps client, and automatically get analytics on every LLM call.

```python python
import agentops

# Beginning of program's code (i.e. main.py, __init__.py)
ao_client = agentops.Client(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)

...
# (optional: record specific functions)
@ao_client.record_action('sample function being record')
def sample_function(...):
    ...

# End of program
ao_client.end_session('Success')
# Woohoo You're done 🎉
```

Refer to our [API documentation](http://docs.agentops.ai) for detailed instructions.

### Why AgentOps? 🤔

Our mission is to bring your agent from protype to production.

Agent developers often work with little to no visibility into agent testing performance. This means their agents never leave the lab. We're changing that. 

AgentOps is the easiest way to evaluate, grade, and test agents. Is there a feature you'd like to see AgentOps cover? Just raise it in the issues tab, and we'll work on adding it to the roadmap.
