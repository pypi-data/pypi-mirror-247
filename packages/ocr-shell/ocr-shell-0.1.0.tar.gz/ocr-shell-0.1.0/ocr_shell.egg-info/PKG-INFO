# OCR Shell

OCR Shell is a convenient command-line tool for quick and easy text extraction from images. Whether you have an image in your clipboard or a saved file, OCR Shell makes it easy to extract text without the hassle of manual handling.

## Prerequisite

### Tesseract OCR

* On Windows, you can download an installer from the [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
* On macOS, you can install Tesseract using Homebrew with the command `brew install tesseract`.

Make sure the `tesseract` is found on your executable PATH.

## Installation

To install OCR Shell, simply run:

```sh
pip install ocr-shell
```

This command will install OCR Shell and all its dependencies.

```sh
$ ocr
... text found in the copied image ...
```

OCR Shell also works with saved images. Just provide the path to the image:

```sh
$ ocr ~/Desktop/Screenshot.png
... more text extracted ...
```
