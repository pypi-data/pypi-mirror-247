def loop(fn):
    """
    Decorator function for methods to run continuously. This will basically create a "while True loop" wrapper around
    the provided function. This is purely syntactic sugar for run_task.

    Your method needs to return an awaitable that is awaited after each loop execution before the next iteration.
    However, the returned awaitable does not finish if a service shutdown is requested. It uses ``self.run_coro`` under
    the hood. But it is guaranteed, that the annotated loop function is awaited and not interrupted if a shutdown is
    requested.

    Example:

    ..  code-block:: python

        @loop
        async def log_still_running(self):
            self._logger.info("Service is still running. Next message in 10 seconds.")
