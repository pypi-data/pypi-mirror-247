    This is basically a Pydantic model with the additional handling of subjects. So any Pydantic model should work here,
    as long as it can be serialized using the library ``msgpack``.

    The subject is constructed from the model name, e.g. if your data model is called ``MySpecialModel`` a subject
    ``v1.my_special_subject`` will be created. If you want to have more control over the subject name you may overwrite
    the method :meth:`fastiot.core.data_models.FastIoTData.get_subject` in your data model or create a new model based
    on Pydanticâ€™s :class:`pydantic.BaseModel`. See :ref:`publish-subscribe` for more details about publish and
    subscribe.

    For your own data models please use :class:`fastiot.core.data_models.FastIoTPublish` for data that is simply
    published over the broker. For Request and Response please use :class:`fastiot.core.data_models.FastIoTRequest` and
    :class:`fastiot.core.data_models.FastIoTResponse`.

    This class also implements the magic methode __setattr__, there is a known bug in BaseModel,
    the private attributes cannot be set with the @property, this overrode methode makes it possible.
