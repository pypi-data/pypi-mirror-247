pip install musaddiquehussainlabs
```

## Usage

```python
from musaddiquehussainlabs.nlp_components import nlp
from musaddiquehussainlabs.text_preprocessing import preprocess_text, to_lower, remove_email, remove_url, remove_punctuation, lemmatize_word
from musaddiquehussainlabs.document_analysis import DocumentAnalysis

data_to_process = "The employee's SSN is 859-98-0987. The employee's phone number is 555-555-5555."

# Using NLP component
result = nlp.predict(component_type="ner", input_text=data_to_process)
print(result)

# Text preprocessing
preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(data_to_process)
print(preprocessed_text)

# Custom Text preprocessing
preprocess_functions = [to_lower, remove_email, remove_url, remove_punctuation, lemmatize_word]
preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(data_to_process, preprocess_functions)
print(preprocessed_text)

# Document analysis
document_analysis = DocumentAnalysis()

# Option 1: full analysis
result = document_analysis.full_analysis(data_to_process)

# Option 2: Individual document analysis
result = document_analysis.pii_anonymization(data_to_process)

print(result)
```
