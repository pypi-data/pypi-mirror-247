The SolarEdge2MQTT service is a project designed to read data from a SolarEdge inverter and publish it to an MQTT broker. The service is useful for integrating SolarEdge inverters into home automation systems or other applications that use MQTT for data exchange. It provides real-time monitoring of power flow and other parameters from the inverter. The project is open-source and can be customized to suit specific needs.

*The SolarEdge2MQTT service is currently in an early stage of development. While it is functional and can be used to read data from a SolarEdge inverter and publish it to an MQTT broker, it is still undergoing active development. Features may be added, removed, or changed, and there may be bugs. Users should be aware of this and use the service with caution. Despite its early state, the project is open-source and contributions are welcome.*

## Installation and Configuration

Install and update using pip.
```
pip install -U solaredge2mqtt
```

Install and update using docker
```
docker pull ghcr.io/deroetzi/solaredge2mqtt:latest
```

### Service configuration

The service is configured by environment variables. The following options can be set:

Environment Variable             | default (production/development) | description

SE2MQTT_USERNAME                 | *None*                           | Username to authenticate to your MQTT broker
SE2MQTT_PASSWORD                 | *None*                           | Password to authenticate to your MQTT broker
SE2MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX             | solaredge                        | SolarEdge2MQTT will use this as prefix topic
SE2MQTT_INTERVAL                 | 5                                | Interval between requests in seconds
SE2MQTT_LOGGING_LEVEL            | INFO                             | Set logging level to DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL


#### Example configuration

You can download [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerOetzi/solaredge2mqtt/master/core/.env.example) and rename it to `.env`. Inside, you can modify the default configuration values to meet your needs in this file.

## Run the service 

### In the console

Copy the [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerOetzi/solaredge2mqtt/master/core/.env.example) file to .env and modify it according to your needs.

Then, simply run `solaredge2mqtt` to start the service.

### With docker:

```
docker run --name solaredge2mqtt --rm \
    -e "SE2MQTT_MODBUS_HOST=<INVERTER_IP>" \
    -e "SE2MQTT_BROKER=<BROKER_IP>" \
    -e "SE2MQTT_USERNAME=<MQTT_USERNAME>" \
    -e "SE2MQTT_PASSWORD=<MQTT_PASSWORD>" \
    -e "TZ=Europe/Berlin" \
    ghcr.io/deroetzi/solaredge2mqtt:latest
```

Add optional environment arguments from above to fit to your setup.
