# LionAGI
**Towards Automated General Intelligence**

LionAGI is a Python intelligent agent framework that combines data manipulation with AI tools, aiming to simplify the integration of advanced machine learning tools, such as Large Language Models (i.e. OpenAI's GPT), with production-level data-centric projects. 

Install LionAGI with pip:

```bash
pip install lionagi
```
Download the `.env_template` file, input your OPENAI_API_KEY, save the file, rename as `.env` and put in your project's root directory. 

### Features

- Robust performance. LionAGI is written in almost pure python. With minimum external dependency (`aiohttp`, `httpx`, `python-dotenv`, `tiktoken`)
- Efficient data operations for reading, chunking, binning, writing, storing and managing data.
- Fast interaction with LLM services like OpenAI with **configurable rate limiting concurrent API calls** for maximum throughput. 
- Create a production ready LLM application **in hours**. Intuitive workflow management to streamline and expedite the process from idea to market.

---
Currently, LionAGI only natively support OpenAI API calls, support for other LLM providers as well as open source models will be integrated in future releases. LionAGI is designed to be async only, please check python official documentation on how `async` work: [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)


**Notice**: 
* calling API with maximum throughput over large set of data with advanced models i.e. gpt-4 can get **EXPENSIVE IN JUST SECONDS**,
* please know what you are doing, and check the usage on OpenAI regularly
* default rate limits are set to be **tier 1** of OpenAI model `gpt-4-1104-preview`, please check the [OpenAI usage limit documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits?context=tier-free) you can modify token rate parameters to fit different use cases.
* Documentation is under process


### Quick Start

The following example shows how to use LionAGI's `Session` object to interact with `gpt-4` model:

```python
import lionagi as li

# define system messages, context and user instruction
system = "You are a helpful assistant designed to perform calculations."
instruction = {"Addition":"Add the two numbers together i.e. x+y"}
context = {"x": 10, "y": 5}

# Initialize a session with a system message
calculator = li.Session(system=system)

# run a LLM API call
result = await calculator.initiate(instruction=instruction,
                                   context=context,
                                   model="gpt-4-1106-preview")

print(f"Calculation Result: {result}")
```
