The way that we add parts like the **Table Header** and *footnotes* in the **Table Footer** is to use the `tab_*()` family of methods. A **Table Header** is easy to add so let's see how the previous table looks with a **title** and a **subtitle**. We can add this part using the `tab_header()` method:


```{python}
from great_tables import GT, md, html
from great_tables.data import islands

islands_mini = islands.head(10)

# Make a display table with the `islands_tbl`
# table; put a heading just above the column labels
(GT(islands_mini)
    .tab_header(
title = "Large Landmasses of the World",
subtitle = "The top ten largest are presented"
    )
)

```


The **Header** table part provides an opportunity to describe the data that's presented. The `subtitle`, which functions as a subtitle, is an optional part of the **Header**. We may also style the `title` and `subtitle` using Markdown! We do this by wrapping the values passed to `title` or `subtitle` with the `md()` function. Here is an example with the table data truncated for brevity:


```{python}
# Make a display table with the `islands_tbl`
# table; put a heading just above the column labels
gt_tbl = (GT(islands.head(2))
    .tab_header(
title = md("Large Landmasses of the World"),
subtitle = md("The top ten largest are presented")
    )
)

gt_tbl
```


A **source note** can be added to the table's **footer** through use of the `tab_source_note()` method. It works in the same way as `tab_header()` (it also allows for Markdown inputs) except it can be called multiple times---each invocation results in the addition of a source note.

```{python}
# Display the `islands_tbl` data with a heading and
# two source notes
(gt_tbl
    .tab_source_note(
        source_note = "Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406."
    )
    .tab_source_note(
        source_note = md("Reference: McNeil, D. R. (1977) *Interactive Data Analysis*. Wiley.")
    )

)
```
