# github:python-whois
# pypi: whois

  * A Python package for retrieving WHOIS information of DOMAIN'S ONLY.

For all further info:

  * see [WhoisDomain](https://github.com/mboot-github/WhoisDomain)
  * all future development will take place on WhoisDomain

### Notes for Mac users
  * it has been observed that the default cli whois on Mac is showing each forward step in its output, this makes parsing the result very unreliable.
  * using a brew install whois will give in general better results.

## Support
 * Python 2.x IS NOT supported.
 * Python 3.x is supported for x >= 9

## Updates
  * see the Readme at [WhoisDomain](https://github.com/mboot-github/WhoisDomain)
