%==========================================================================
The GObs time series are derived from version 0136 (from May 2023) of the ground observatory hourly means between 1997 and 2023 from the database AUX_OBS prepared by the British Geological Survey (BGS): ftp://ftp.nerc-murchison.ac.uk/geomag/Swarm/AUX_OBS/hour/ 

Any papers published using these data are requested to include the following acknowledgement

"The staff of the geomagnetic observatories and INTERMAGNET are thanked for supplying high-quality observatory data."

The GO composite cdf files have a format in accordance with GVO Swarm cdf files described in the document SW-DS-DTU-GS-004_2-1_GVO_PDD.
In addition to this they contain extra variables bias_crust (containing the estimated observatory bias) and Obs containing the IAGA observatory code.

1) 1-month GObs
    B_OB: observed field time series
    - Robust 1 monthly means from HMV, computed in 1 month bins, no corrections or data selection applied

    B_CF: core field time series
    -  Robust 1 monthly means from HMV, after subtracting CM4 SQ field predictions and CHAOS-7.11 external field predictions, with input from RC index RC_1997-2023_June_v4.dat. In the literature these are revered to as revised monthly means - see Olsen et al. (2014) for details. 

    B_SV: core field time series
    - Secular variation computed as annual differences of B_CF time series i.e. annual differences of revised monthly means

    sigma_OB, sigma_CF, sigma_SV: error estimates
    - Derived from variances calculated from detrended residuals from CHAOS observed/core/secular variation field

    bias_crust: 
    - observatory bias computed as the median of residuals between B_CF and CHAOS-7.15 field predictions to SH degree 14 for each component at each observatory

2) 4-month GObs
    B_OB: observed field time series
    - Robust 4 monthly means from HMV, computed in 4 month bins 

    B_CF: core field time series
    -  Robust 4 monthly means from HMV, after subtracting CM4 SQ predictions and CHAOS-7.11 external field model, with input from RC index RC_1997-2023_June_v4.dat These are  4-monthly versions of the revised monthly means of Olsen et al. (2014). 

    B_SV: core field time series
    - Secular variation computed as annual differences of B_CF time series

    sigma_OB, sigma_CF, sigma_SV: error estimates
    - Derived from variances derived from detrended residuals from CHAOS observed/core/secular variation field

    bias_crust: 
    - estimated observatory bias (mostly from the crust) computed as median of residuals between B_CF and CHAOS-7.15 field predictions to SH degree 14 for each component at each observatory

3) 1-year GObs
    B_OB: observed field time series
    - Robust annual means from HMV, computed in annual bins 

    B_CF: core field time series
    -  Robust annual means from HMV, after subtracting CM4 SQ predictions and CHAOS-7.15 external field model, with input from RC index RC_1997-2023_June_v4.dat These are  annual versions of the revised monthly means of Olsen et al. (2014). 

    B_SV: core field time series
    - Secular variation computed as annual differences of B_CF time series

    sigma_OB, sigma_CF, sigma_SV: error estimates
    - Derived from variances derived from detrended residuals from CHAOS observed/core/secular variation field

    bias_crust: 
    - estimated observatory bias (mostly from the crust) computed as median of residuals between B_CF and CHAOS-7.15 field predictions to SH degree 14 for each component at each observatory
