`pip install easyphysi`

or clone the GitHub repository.

`gh repo clone girdeux31/easyPhysi`

The following third-party modules are requirements.

 - matplotlib>=3.7.0
 - scipy>=1.11.0
 - sympy==1.12

## <a id="sec-usage"></a>2. Usage

### <a id="sec-main-structure"></a>2.0. Main structure

Most pre-university physics problems can be solved following this structure composed of a few lines.

```
from easyphysi.drivers.universe import Universe
from easyphysi.drivers.body import Body

universe = Universe(dimensions=2)  # 2 o 3 dimensions, default is 2
universe.set('my_prop', value)

body = Body('my_body', dimensions=2)  # 2 o 3 dimensions, default is 2
body.set('my_prop', value)

# define more properties or more bodies as needed

universe.add_body(body)

# add more bodies as needed

solution = universe.physics_equation('my_body').solve('my_unknown')
```

Let's take the code apart line by line. 

 - Line 1 and 2: import `Universe` and `Body` objects, these are needed in every single problem solved with easyPhysi.
 - Line 4: define a universe instance with `Universe` class. The `dimensions` is an optional argument, but only 2 o 3 dimensions are allowed, default is 2.
 - Line 5: define as many properties for the universe as needed. Universe properties are listed in [Table](#tab-universe-properties), name and value must be included as arguments. Values must be consistent with property type, see [Section](#sec-property-types).
 - Line 7: define as many body instances as needed with `Body` class provided that they have different names. Its name must be included as first argument, the `dimensions` is an optional argument, but only 2 o 3 dimensions are allowed, default is 2.
 - Line 8: define as many properties for the body as needed. Body properties are listed in [Table](#tab-body-properties), name and value must be included as arguments. Values must be consistent with property type, see [Section](#sec-property-types).
 - Line 12: add all defined bodies to the universe (body and universe dimensions must match).
 - Line 16: solve the relevant physics equation over a specific body and define the unknown(s). See a list of allowed equations and unknowns in [Table](#tab-equations).

> **Note:** Define all bodies and properties before solving any equation.

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-ef2) defines a 3D problem.

### <a id="sec-properties"></a>2.1. Properties

Some properties are defined on a body, while others are defined on a universe. [Table](#tab-body-properties) list all properties that are allowed to be defined on a body.

> **Note:** Property names are case sensitive.

<a id="tab-body-properties"></a>

 |Property |Description                     |Type      |Components           |
 |---------|--------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
 |a        |Acceleration                    |Vector    |(a_x, a_y[, a_z])    |
 |q        |Charge                          |Scalar    |q                    |
 |Fe       |Electrical force                |Vector    |(Fe_x, Fe_y[, Fe_z]) |
 |Ue       |Electrical potential energy     |Scalar    |Ue                   |

 |Ug       |Gravitational potential energy  |Scalar    |Ug                   |
 |p0       |Initial position                |Vector    |(p0_x, p0_y[, p0_z]) |
 |v0       |Initial velocity                |Vector    |(v0_x, v0_y[, v0_z]) |
 |m        |Mass                            |Scalar    |m                    |

 |v        |Velocity                        |Vector    |(v_x, v_y[, v_z])    |

[Table](#tab-universe-properties) list all properties that are allowed to be defined in a universe.

<a id="tab-universe-properties"></a>

 |Property |Description                     |Type      |Value                |
 |---------|--------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
 |Ee       |Electrical field intensity      |Vector    |(Ee_x, Ee_y[, Ee_z]) |
 |Ve       |Electrical potential            |Scalar    |Ve                   |
 |gg       |Gravitational field intensity   |Vector    |(gg_x, gg_y[, gg_z]) |
 |Vg       |Gravitational potential         |Scalar    |Vg                   |
 |g        |Gravity                         |Vector    |(g_x, g_y[, g_z])    |
 |t        |Time                            |Scalar    |t                    |

Use `set` method in an instanciated body or universe to define its property and define its value according to its type, see [Section](#sec-property-types).

> **Note:** Units are up to the user. Even though SI is recommended, other systems can be used provided that different units are consistent.

> **Note:** Force and energy cannot be defined as properties since each force and energy is defined by its own algebraic formula, see [Section](#sec-property-nondefined).

#### <a id="sec-property-types"></a>2.1.0. Property types

There are two types of properties: **scalars** (for example `m` for mass) and **vectors** (for example `g` for gravity).

##### <a id="sec-property-type-scalar"></a>2.1.0.i Scalars

They are integers of floats, examples follow.

```
body.set('prop', 250)       # int
body.set('prop', 5.0E-9)    # float
```

##### <a id="sec-property-type-vectors"></a>2.1.0.ii Vectors

They are list or tuples (either integers or floats), examples follow.

```
body.set('prop', [0.0, -9.81])  # list
body.set('prop', (0, +3))       # tuple
```

The length of `value` (components) must be the same as defined in the instance of the body or universe the property applies to.

> **Note:** It is also possible to define only one component in a vector parameter (the other may be irrelevant or unknown). To do so, append `_x`, `_y` or `_z` to the property name according to the desired axis.

```
body.set('prop_x', value_x)
body.set('prop_y', value_y)
body.set('prop_z', value_z)
```

#### <a id="sec-property-nondefined"></a>2.1.1. Non-defined properties

Force (mainly used in `newton_equation`) and energy (mainly used in `energy_conservation_equation`) cannot be defined as properties in an instanciated body (note that they are not listed in [Table](#tab-equations)). Instead they can be defined in with `add_force` and `add_energy` methods over any instanciated body.

```
body.add_force('my_force', value)
body.add_energy('my_energy', value)
```

This is designed on purpose because many different forces and energies can apply to a body and could have different algebraic expressions. Thus, the algebraic expression for the force and energy must be defined by the user.

See examples for Newton equation and energy conservation equation in [Dynamic Examples](#sec-example-dynamics) and [Energy Conservation Examples](#sec-example-energy-conservation) respectively.

### <a id="sec-special-bodies"></a>2.2. Special bodies

Special bodies are pre-defined bodies that are ready to be used. There are two types of special bodies: subatomic particles and celestial bodies, see following tables. The mass and charge of subatomic particles are defined in kilograms and coulombs.

<a id="tab-body-particles"></a>

| Body     | Mass (kg) | Charge (C) |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| electron | 9.109e-31 | -1.602e-19 |
| proton   | 1.673e-27 | 1.602e-19  |
| neutron  | 1.675e-27 | 0.0        |

The mass and position of celestial bodies are defined in kilograms and kilometers.

> **Note:** The distance of celestial bodies is the average distance to the Sun (except for the Moon, which is the average distance to the Earth) and is defined in the x-axis.

<a id="tab-body-celestial"></a>

| Body     | Mass (kg) | Position (km) |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| sun      | 1.988e30  | 0.0           |
| mercury  | 3.301e23  | 57900000      |
| venus    | 4.867e24  | 108200000     |
| earth    | 5.972e24  | 149600000     |
| moon     | 7.348e22  | 384400        |
| mars     | 6.417e23  | 227900000     |
| jupiter  | 1.899e27  | 778600000     |
| saturn   | 5.685e26  | 1433500000    |
| uranus   | 8.682e25  | 2872500000    |
| neptune  | 1.024e26  | 4495100000    |

Import them using the following line and use them without instanciating the body or defining its main properties.

`from easyphysi.drivers.body import special_body`

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-ef1) imports an electron from special bodies.
 
### <a id="sec-equations"></a>2.3. Equations

The following equations can be solved, each one is a method defined in the `Universe` class.

> **Note:** Equation names are case sensitive.

<a id="tab-equations"></a>

 |Equation                                |Type      |Unknowns        |
 |----------------------------------------|----------|--------------- |
 |electrical_field_intensity_equation     |Vectorial |Ee, p, q        |
 |electrical_force_equation               |Vectorial |Fe, p, q        |
 |electrical_potential_energy_equation    |Scalar    |Ue, p, q        |
 |electrical_potential_equation           |Scalar    |Ve, p, q        |
 |energy_conservation_equation            |Scalar    |- 		      |
 |gravitational_field_intensity_equation  |Vectorial |gg, m, p        |
 |gravitational_force_equation            |Vectorial |Fg, m, p        |
 |gravitational_potential_energy_equation |Scalar    |Ug, m, p        |
 |gravitational_potential_equation        |Scalar    |Vg, m, p        |
 |linear_position_equation                |Vectorial |g, p, p0, t, v0 |
 |linear_velocity_equation                |Vectorial |g, t, v, v0 	  |
 |newton_equation                         |Vectorial |a, m 	          |
 
Use any of these equation in an instance of universe and include the body the equation applies to. Then use the `solve` method and include the unknown(s) to be solved, see third column in  table above.

`universe.physics_equation('my_body').solve('my_unknown')`

#### <a id="sec-equation-types"></a>2.3.0. Equation types

There are two types of equations: scalar (for example `energy_conservation_equation`) and vectorial (for example `newton_equation`).

##### <a id="sec-equation-type-scalar"></a>2.3.0.i Scalar

Only one unknown is accepted.

```
out = universe.physics_equation('my_body').solve('my_unk')
```

> **Note:** The output is always a list of roots.

##### <a id="sec-equation-type-vectorial"></a>2.3.0.ii Vectorial

As many unknowns as universe dimensions are accepted, these must be defined as a list and passed as argument of `solve` method. Vector components must be append to unknown names, such as `a_x`, `a_y` and `a_z` for acceleration, see [Section](#sec-property-type-vectors). The same number of unknowns must be defined as outputs, no name restriction apply for output unknowns.

```
out_x, out_y = universe.physics_equation('my_body').solve(['unk_x', 'unk_y'])
```

> **Note:** The output always has as many list of roots as unknowns.

### <a id="sec-advance-features"></a>2.4. Advance features

The most useful features are already defined. However, for the sake of completeness, a few more features for the advance user are defined in this section.

#### <a id="sec-other-feature-magnitude"></a>2.4.0. Vector module

Function `magnitude` is available to obtain a vector module or magnitude.

```
from easyphysi.utils import magnitude
prop = magnitude((prop_x, prop_y))
```

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-k0) makes use of `magnitude` function to calculate the modulo of the velocity.

#### <a id="sec-other-feature-symbol"></a>2.4.1. Define new unknowns

Most unknowns are already defined when a universe or body are instanciated, see [Table](#tab-universe-properties) and [Table](#tab-body-properties). However, sometimes new unknowns must be defined, specially with Newton equations and energy conservation equations since force and energy algebraic expressions are defined by user. In these case, `Symbol` class from Sympy library can be used. Then, it can be used as argument in `solve` method to calculate its numerical value.

```
from sympy import Symbol
my_unknown = Symbol('my_unknown')
```

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-ec0) makes uso of `Symbol` class to define the final velocity (`vf`) as an unknown and then solve its value.

#### <a id="sec-other-feature-subs"></a>2.4.2. Substitute variable

Method `solve` returns numerical values if there is only one unknown (all properties are defined but one), but returns expressions if there is more than one unknown (two or more properties are left undefined). Use `subs` method to replace an unknown by a specified numerical value.

```
foo = universe.physics_equation('body').solve('my_unk')
out = foo.subs('my_sym', value)
```

> **Note:** There is no need to import `subs` since it is a method inherent in any Sympy expression.

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-d0) makes uso of `subs` method to substitute the friction coefficient by its value.

#### <a id="sec-other-feature-get-equation"></a>2.4.3. Get equation from system

In some cases, it is only interesting to solve a specific equation from a vectorial equation (that is a set of equations or a system). The method `get_equation` can be used over any vectorial equation to return the specific equation, the axis component is expected as method argument.

`universe.physics_equation('my_body').get_equation('axis')`

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-k0) makes use of `get_equation` method to extract an equation from a vectorial equation (or set of equations) and, then, solve its unknown.

#### <a id="sec-other-feature-solve-systems"></a>2.4.4. Solving system of equations

System of equations can be defined -with `System` class- and solved with `solve` method. The `solve` method accepts a list with as many unknowns as equations defined in the system.

```
from easyphysi.drivers.system import System

equation = universe.physics_equation('body').solve('my_unk')

system = System()
system.add_equation(equation)

# define and add as many equations as needed

x, y, z = system.solve(['x', 'y', 'z'])
```

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-d2) makes use of `System` class to solve a set of equations.

#### <a id="sec-other-feature-plot"></a>2.4.5. Plotting equations

Method `plot` can be used over any equation -scalar or vectorial- to plot unknowns in the form of function `independent = f(dependent)`.

`universe.physics_equation('my_body').plot(independent, dependent, x_range, points=100, path=None, show=True)`

Arguments are described hereafter.

 - `independent`: if equation is [scalar](#sec-equation-type-scalar), then only one independent unknown is expected. If equation is [vectorial](#sec-equation-type-vectorial), then a list with length equal to the number of components (or universe dimensions) is expected.
 - `dependent`: exactly one unknown is expected.
 - `x_range`: range to plot for dependent unknown (x-axis).
 - `points`: number of points to plot, optional argument, default is 100.
 - `path`: path to save image as file, optional argument, by default it is None and no image is saved.
 - `show`: if `True` the plot is shown on screen, optional argument, by default it is `True`.

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-ec1) makes uso of `plot` method to plot a scalar equation (final velocity as a function of initial velocity).

## <a id="sec-limitations-bugs"></a>4. Limitations and bugs

### <a id="sec-limitations"></a>4.0. Limitations

* Trigonometric functions are not able to handle symbols or expressions (for example `math.sin`, `math.cos` or `math.atan2`). Therefore, position unknown (`p`) cannot be solved for the following equations (this error is shown: `TypeError: Cannot convert expression to float`):
    - electrical_field_intensity_equation
    - electrical_force_equation
    - gravitational_field_intensity_equation
    - gravitational_force_equation
* For the same reason, when defining forces for `newton_equation` with `add_force` method, the angle cannot be set as un unknown as it is usually inside `math.sin` or `math.cos` functions. Fortunately, since the algebraic formula that defines each force is set by the user, arbitrary unknowns can be set instead of `math.sin(alpha)` or `math.cos(alpha)`. Then, easily get the angle with `math.asin` or `math.acos`.

> **Tip:** [Example](#sec-example-d1) uses this workaround to solve the unknown position in a dynamics problem.
