## Documentation

A high-level `Url` class to make parsing, looking at and manipulating
urls much easier.

Also allows for easily composable urls.

Everything is subject to change!

## Getting Started

```shell

Very basic example:

```python
from xurls import Url

assert url.host == "www.google.com"

url.host = "apple.com"
assert str(url) == "http://apple.com/some/path"
```
