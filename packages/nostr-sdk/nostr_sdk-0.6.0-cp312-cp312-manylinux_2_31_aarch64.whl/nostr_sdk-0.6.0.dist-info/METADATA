# Nostr SDK - Python Package

## Description

A high-level, [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) client library.

If you're writing a typical Nostr client or bot, this is likely the crate you need.

However, the crate is designed in a modular way and depends on several other lower-level libraries. If you're attempting something more custom, you might be interested in these:

- [`nostr-protocol`](https://pypi.org/project/nostr-protocol/): Implementation of Nostr protocol

## Getting started

```shell
pip install nostr-sdk
```

```python
from nostr_sdk import Keys, Client, EventBuilder, Filter
import time

keys = Keys.generate()
print(keys.public_key().to_bech32())

client = Client(keys)

client.add_relay("wss://relay.damus.io")
client.connect()

print("Mining a POW text note...")
event = EventBuilder.new_text_note("Hello from Rust Nostr Python bindings!", []).to_pow_event(keys, 20)
event_id = client.send_event(event)
print("Event sent:")
print(f" hex:    {event_id.to_hex()}")
print(f" bech32: {event_id.to_bech32()}")

time.sleep(2.0)

print("Getting events from relays...")
filter = Filter().authors([keys.public_key().to_hex()])
events = client.get_events_of([filter], None)
for event in events:
    print(event.as_json())
```
