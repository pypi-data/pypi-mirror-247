# EUMDAC - EUMETSAT Data Access Client

**EUMDAC** is the **EUM**ETSAT **D**ata **A**ccess **C**lient. It provides simple access to the EUMETSAT data of all satellite missions. As a **Python library**, it comes with many methods and helpers to use EUMETSATs APIs and services, like Data Store and Data Tailor. As a **CLI**, it provides a variety of useful command line utilities for data search, translation and processing.

Check the [EUMDAC knowledge base](https://eumetsatspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EUMDAC/overview) for more information on installing and using the CLI and library.

## Prerequisites
 
You will need a python environment to run the library implementation of this code. EUMDAC requires Python 3.7 or higher. We recommend that you install the latest Anaconda Python distribution for your operating system (https://www.anaconda.com/). No prerequisites are identified for running the CLI binary.

## Installing the EUMDAC library and CLI

### Installing with PIP

The EUMDAC Python package is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):
```bash
pip install eumdac
```

### Installing with Conda

To install EUMDAC on the Anaconda Python distribution, please visit the [EUMETSAT conda-forge page](https://anaconda.org/Eumetsat/repo) for install instructions.
```bash
conda install -c eumetsat-forge eumdac
```

### Installing from source

To install EUMDAC from the development source, clone the repository and install it locally.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/data-services/eumdac.git
cd eumdac
pip install .
```

## Using the EUMDAC CLI binaries (no installation required)
If an installation of EUMDAC is not possible due to missing technical prerequisites, we recommend to use our binaries. These executable applications allow you to use all the functions of the CLI without installation. 

The binaries are available for Windows, Linux and Mac in the [Releases section](https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/data-services/eumdac/-/releases).

You can find more information in the [EUMDAC knowledge base](https://eumetsatspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EUMDAC/pages/1759805454/Command+Line+User+Guide).
