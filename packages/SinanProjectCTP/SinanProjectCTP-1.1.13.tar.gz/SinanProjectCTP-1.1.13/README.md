## Accessing the Ctrader FIX API


To access your API, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the cTrader desktop or web platform.
2. In the bottom left corner of the platform, you will find the **Settings** option. Click on it.
3. A popup window will appear. In the menu of the popup, look for the last option: **FIX API**.
4. First, click on the **Change Password** button. Make sure to add a numeric password of at least 8 digits.
5. After changing the password, click on the **Copy to Clipboard** button from  **Trade Connection**.
6. Now, let's move to the **Trade Connection** section. Here, you will receive your data in the following format (this is an example with IC Markets for a real account):

   - Host name: (Current IP address 168.205.95.20 can be changed without notice)
   - Port: 5212 (SSL), 5202 (Plain text)
   - Password: (a/c 1104928 password)
   - SenderCompID: live.icmarkets.1104926 or demo.icmarkets.1104926  or live2.icmarkets.1104926 
   - TargetCompID: cServer
   - SenderSubID: TRADE





### Import libraries

```python
from SinanProjectCTP import Ctrader
```

### Fix account login and details

```python
server="168.205.95.20" # - Host name: (Current IP address 168.205.95.20 can be changed without notice)
account="live.icmarkets.1104926" #  - SenderCompID: live.icmarkets.1104926
password="12345678" # - The password you configured

api = Ctrader(server,account,password)

```
##### Check the connection status
```python
api.isconnected()
```
##### Logout 
```python
api.logout()
```

#### Real-time quote

##### Subscribe to symbols
```python
api.subscribe("EURUSD", "GBPUSD")
```
##### List of quotes for all symbols
```python
quote = api.quote()
print(quote)

# Output

{'EURUSD': {'bid': 1.02616, 'ask': 1.02618}, 'GBPUSD': {'bid': 1.21358, 'ask': 1.21362}}
```

#### Quote for a single symbol 
```python
quote = api.quote("EURUSD")
print(quote)

# Output

{'bid': 1.02612, 'ask': 1.02614}

```
### Market position and pending orders.

##### Market position

```python
# Buy position
price = api.quote()
price = price['EURUSD']['bid'] 

symbol = "EURUSD"
volume = 0.01 # position size:
stoploss =  round(price - 0.00010,6)
takeprofit = round(price + 0.00010,6)

id = api.buy(symbol, volume, stoploss, takeprofit)
print(f"Position: {id}")

# sell position 
price = api.quote()
price = price['EURUSD']['bid'] 

symbol = "EURUSD"
volume = 0.01 # position size
stoploss =  round(price + 0.00010,6)
takeprofit = round(price - 0.00010,6)

id = api.sell(symbol, volume, stoploss, takeprofit)
print(f"Position: {id}")
```

##### Limit Orders

```python

# Buy limit order

symbol = "EURUSD"
volume = 0.01 # order size
price = 1.18 # entry price 

id = api.buyLimit(symbol, volume, price)
print(f"Order: {id}")


# Sell limit order

symbol = "EURUSD"
volume = 0.01 # Order size
price = 1.22 # entry price 

id = api.sellLimit(symbol, volume, price)
print(f"Order: {id}")
```

#### Stop Orders

```python

# Buy stop order

symbol = "EURUSD"
volume = 0.01 # order size
price = 1.22 # entry price

id = api.buyStop(symbol, volume, price)
print(f"Order: {id}")

# Sell stop order

symbol = "EURUSD"
volume = 0.01 # order size
price = 1.18 # entry price 

api.sellStop(symbol, volume, price)

```

#### List Positions

```python
positions = api.positions()
print(positions)

```
#### List limit and stop Orders

```python
orders = api.orders()
print(orders)

```
#### Cancel order by id

```python
orders = api.orders()
for order in orders:
    api.orderCancelById(order['ord_id'])

```
#### Close position by id

```python
for position in positions:
    api.positionCloseById(position['pos_id'], position['amount'])

```

#### Cancel all orders

```python
api.cancel_all()
```

#### Close all positions

```python
api.close_all()
```
#### Parcial Close position 

```python
api.positionPartialClose(id, volume) 
```

### Disclosure

Due to certain limitations of the FIX API, there's a specific issue that arises when both the Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) features are used concurrently. This issue occurs when one of them is triggered, the other remains open and will execute when the price reaches the specified level again, causing it to open another order. This issue needs to be addressed either within the SinanProjectCTP library or the application itself.

However, you can avoid this problem by using either the SL or TP, but not both simultaneously.
