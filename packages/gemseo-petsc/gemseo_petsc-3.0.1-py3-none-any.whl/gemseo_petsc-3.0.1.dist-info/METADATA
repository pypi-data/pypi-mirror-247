PETSc GEMSEO interface.

This plugin provides an interface to the PETSc linear solvers. They can
be used for direct and adjoint linear system resolution in GEMSEO.

# Installation

**gemseo-petsc** relies on **petsc4py**, the Python bindings for
**PETSc**. **PETSc** and **petsc4py** are available on pypi, but no
wheel are available. Hence, depending on the initial situation, here are
our recommendations:

## Linux environment

### Using Conda

**PETSc** and **petsc4py** are available on the conda-forge repository.
If you start from scratch of if you want to install the plugin in a
pre-existing conda environment, you can use the following command in
your current conda environment before installing gemseo-petsc:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge petsc4py
```

### Using pip

**PETSc** and **petsc4py** can be build from their sources by using pip.
To do so, use the following commands in your Python environment.

```shell
pip install petsc petsc4py
```

### By building PETSc and petsc4py from sources

It is also possible to build **PETSc** and **petsc4py** from the PETSc
sources. To do so, please follow the information provided in the [PETSc
installation manual](https://petsc.org/release/install/), and do not
forget to enable the compilation of **petsc4py**.

## Windows environment

Although it has not be tested, it is possible to build **PETSc** and
**petsc4py** under a Windows environment, and hence to have the
**gemseo-petsc** plugin working. A description of the procedure to build
these dependencies can be found
[here](https://openmdao.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.3/getting-started/mpi_windows.html)
