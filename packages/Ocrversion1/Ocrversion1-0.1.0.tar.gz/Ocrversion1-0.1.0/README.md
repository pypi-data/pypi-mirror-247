OCR API Playground 


We have build an OCR Model to extract data from images. It involves the following feature: 

We have built an OCR which can read and extract English texts from an image. 

It will also work with the texts of all the other languages like Bengali, Hindi etc. except for East Asian Languages like Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. 

We have also included a feature of drawing a bounding box around the specific area of the image which we want to extract and thus extract the particular portion. 

We proposed a layer where we required a UI. A dummy UI pattern is drawn below.
