These are templates to be used by the kreate-kube framework

It is meant that these templates should cover most common use case,
but of course you can add your own templates.

If you want to modify these templates, contact Mark Hooijkaas.
You can also create your own git repository and either:
- add new templates with a different name
- override existing templates with a new template file
