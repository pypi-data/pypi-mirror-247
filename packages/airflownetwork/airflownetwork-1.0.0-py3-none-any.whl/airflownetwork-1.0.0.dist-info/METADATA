## About
This is a small library of functions and classes to examine EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork models. A driver program is provided to analyze models in the epJSON format. To summarize the model contents:

```
airflownetwork summarize my_model.epJSON
```

To create a graph of the model in the DOT format:

```
airflownetwork graph my_model.epJSON
```

To generate an audit of the model:

```
airflownetwork audit my_model.epJSON
```

Further help is available on the command line:

```
airflownetwork --help
```

## Installation

```console
pip install airflownetwork
```
