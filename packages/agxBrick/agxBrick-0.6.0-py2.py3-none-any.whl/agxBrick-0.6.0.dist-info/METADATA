# agxBrick

agxBrick is a python package (with C# runtime implementation) for loading Brick.yml files with [AGX Dynamics](https://www.algoryx.se/agx-dynamics/).

The development of agxBrick has come to an end, since the ReBRICK C++ project will replace and go beyond the experience of "old" BRICK.

This distributable is free to use for anyone, but do not expect any additional features or bugfixes.
