Cup:
  .doc: > 
    The suction cup include sensors for detecting objects which will
    be attracted with a suction force. The magnitude of the force depend
    on the vacuum system, if the suction cup lip is sealed and the distance to the 
    object. See AGX documentation for details.
    If a path to a Physics.Geometry.Trimesh is specified for the
    deformingGeometryPath, that specific trimesh will deform visually.
    The trimesh will assume a shape that fits between the origin of the suction cup
    body and the attachment to the non-cup body of the connector attribute of the cup, 
    according to the initial state.
    Example: If the cup body is positioned 3cm below the attachemnt of a another body by a connector
    no mather the initial size of the trimesh, it will be squeezed/stretched to fit there. 
    The direction of the stretching is defined by the localMeshDirection attribute.
