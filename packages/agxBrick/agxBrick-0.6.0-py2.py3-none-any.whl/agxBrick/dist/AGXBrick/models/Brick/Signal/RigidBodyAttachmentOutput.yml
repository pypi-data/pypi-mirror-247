RigidBodyAttachmentOutput:
  .extends: Signal.NodeVectorOutput
  .doc: > 
    Outputs a Vec3 given some 3D data in a RigidBodyAttachment.
    Data is expected to be to be computed externally,
    updated by the UpdateData function
    and cached in local variable.
    
    The parent body of the RigidBodyAttachment will by default
    define the coordinate system for the Vector Output,
    unless the referenceFrame attribute is not default.
    If the referenceFrame is declared to null (not default null),
    the vector output is in world coordinates.
