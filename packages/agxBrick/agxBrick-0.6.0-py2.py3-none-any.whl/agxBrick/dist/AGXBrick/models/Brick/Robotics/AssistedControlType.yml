AssistedControlType:
  .doc: >
    A status for a Robotics.Robot using inverse dynamics to control
    the robot joints in different ways. Forces will be added to each joint
    with inputSignalType set to InputForceSignal.
    All included RigidBodies will be included in the system that computes the 
    forces and torques, including non force controlled joints and other connectors.
    If there are components or RigidBodies outside the robot definition to be 
    included in the assisted control system, RigidBodies to grasp or to collide 
    with, those should be added to the assistedControlExternals list of the Robot.

  .doc: >
    When set to a Robot, all Joints with inputSignalType set to InputForceSignal
    of all included RobotArm's will be gravity compensated. This means that
    forces will be added to those joints to keep the robot in its current 
    position. External forces added will however change the movement of the
    robot.

SequentialInverseDynamics:

  .doc: >
    Will listen for instructions for wanted position and orientation for a 
    specific rigid body, in a specific time. On updated, instructions for a 
    control path is calculated, adding forces at the controlled joints to reach
    the wanted position. When the wanted position is reached, all force inputs 
    will stop. Will not recalibrate path or forces added until after a new 
    position is set.

AdaptiveInverseDynamics:

  .doc: >
    Inverse dynamics with a sync of all transforms and velocities for each time step.
    Will try to reach a specific pose in space, just like SequentialInverseDynamics, 
    and is preferable if contacts with unknown objects might happen.
    Will listen to the same signal inputs also, and the target and target time can be 
    changed every frame, if wanted.

SequentialInverseDynamicsWithGravityCompensation:
  .extends: AssistedControlType
  .doc: >
    Similar to SequentialInverseDynamics, but when reaching a position 
    GravityCompensation is activated, so that the robot stays at the given 
    position. When a new position is given, GravityCompensation is disablead 
    and SequentialInverseDynamics activated again.
