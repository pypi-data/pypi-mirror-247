    Outputs a Vec3 given some 3D data in a node.
    Data is expected to be to be computed externally,
    updated by the UpdateData function
    and cached in local variable.

      The frame of which coordinate system the resulting vector will be reported in.
      If set to null, the vector will be reported in the world coordinate system.
