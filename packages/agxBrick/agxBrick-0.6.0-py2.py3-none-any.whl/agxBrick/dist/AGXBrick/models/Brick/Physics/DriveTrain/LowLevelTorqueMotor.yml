    A motor with two gains, which takes the input torque
    and does a inner torque control loop, using the previous torque.
    The torque applied to the motor T_m is computed from:
    T_m = T_d + K_T * (T_d - T_o) + K_S * T_dot
    Where T_d is the desired torque from the controller,
    T_o is the last (time step) measured torque, and T_dot is
    the measured torque time derivative computed from the two last
    measurements.
    The model is presented in the thesis of Wouter Weekers -
    Validation of Nonsmooth Impact Maps in Robot Impact Experiments
