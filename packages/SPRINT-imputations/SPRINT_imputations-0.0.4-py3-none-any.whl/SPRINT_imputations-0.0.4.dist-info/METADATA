# SPRINT

Using SPRINT we do the the imputation. So, when a dataset having absenceny (or NaN), is processed by this algorithm we can get a complete dataset. 


# Installation

You can install the package using below command 


```bash
pip install SPRINT_imputations

```

# Usage 

## First import the package 

```{python}
import SPRINT_imputation
```
## Call the function 'SPRINT'

```{python}
SPRINT_imputation.impute()
```
## Agruments for impute():

- Mandatory
    - Original_Dataframe
    - Tens_shape
- Optional
    - zero_as_missing
    - miss_type
    - missing_rate
    - missing_rate_val
    - block_window
    - ranks
    - max_iter (Keep above 100)
    - hy1_list
    - hyp_prior_list
    - hyper_smooth
    - Batch_per 
    - Batch_iter
    - p

## Output
A matrix (or dataset), without containing any NaNs. 

## :bulb:TIP: Regarding CUPY library 

- Do note that the CUPY library is not mentioned in the 'requirements.txt' and hence is needed to be installed sperately whose detials steps are mentioned here.

- The CUPY library is suppose to be install as per the GPU's driver version more info can be found [here](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html)
    
- If  there is any CUDA PATH issue, one can explictly set the PATH by the following command.
```python
    
    import os 
    os.environ['CUDA_PATH'] = "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.7"
```
### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Warning
> Don't forgot to change the CUDA version in the above code as per your system.
