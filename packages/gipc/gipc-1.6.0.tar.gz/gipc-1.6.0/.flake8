# Ignore the following errors:
#   E402: "module level import not at top of file"
#   E731: "do not assign a lambda expression, use a def"
#   E133: "closing bracket is missing indentation"
#   E123: "closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracket's line"
#   -> Disable flake8 forcing us to decide on both PEP8-compliant styles on
#      putting the closing bracket. If I had to choose, I'd probaby set
#      `hang-closing` to True.
#   W503: either W504 or W503 must be ignored since flake8 3.6.0
#   E741: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'
