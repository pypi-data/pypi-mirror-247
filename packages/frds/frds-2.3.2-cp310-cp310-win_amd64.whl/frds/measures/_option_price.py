    Args:
        S (float): Current price of the underlying asset.
        K (float): Strike (exercise) price of the option.
        r (float): Annualized continuously compounded risk-free rate of return over the life of the option, expressed as a positive decimal number
        T (float): Time to expiration of the option, expressed in years.
        sigma (float): Annualized asset price volatility (i.e., annualized standard deviation of the continuously compounded asset return), expressed as a positive decimal number.
        q (float, optional): Annualized continuously compounded yield of the underlying asset over the life of the option, expressed as a decimal number. Defaults to 0.0.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: Prices of European call and put options
