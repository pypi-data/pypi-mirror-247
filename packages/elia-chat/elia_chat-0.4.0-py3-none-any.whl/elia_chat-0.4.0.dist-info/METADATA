> **Note**
> Elia is still a work in progress. How far will I go with this? I have no idea...

## Quickstart

Install Elia with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx), set your OpenAI API key environment variable,
and start the app:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/darrenburns/elia
export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
elia
```

### Wiping the Chat History

Chat history is stored in a SQLite database alongside the Elia application.
To wipe the chat history, simply run the db reset command:

```bash
elia reset
```

### Changing the Chat Directive

By default, Elia's conversations with ChatGPT are primed with a
directive for the GPT model:

`You are a helpful assistant.`

This can be changed by setting the `ELIA_DIRECTIVE` environment variable before
starting a new conversation. A directive is set for the lifetime of a conversation.

```bash
export ELIA_DIRECTIVE="You are a helpful assistant who talks like a pirate."
elia
```

### Launching Directly into a Conversation

```bash
elia chat write python code to detect a palindrome
```

## Progress updates

### June 2023

Messages are now tokenized and you can see how messages are split into tokens using the "Message Details" modal.

### May 29th 2023

SQLite/SQLModel chosen for persistence.
Conversations can be imported from ChatGPT and they'll be displayed in the sidebar.
Selecting a conversation in the sidebar will load it into the main window.
Raw markdown can be displayed.

### May 24th 2023

Much of the core UI is in place, with some placeholders. No persistence yet, but I've begun to explore it.
