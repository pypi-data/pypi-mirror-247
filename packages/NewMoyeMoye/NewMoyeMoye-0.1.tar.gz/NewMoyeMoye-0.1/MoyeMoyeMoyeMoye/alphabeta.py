    Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm implementation.

    Args:
    state: The current state of the game.
    depth: The current depth of the recursion.
    alpha: The best value that the maximizer currently can guarantee at that level or above.

    The best score that can be achieved by the current player for the current game state.
