# Test Automation Project Setup

This project is a script to set up a new test automation project. It asks the user to select a test framework and a target platform for automation.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script:

```sh
python main.py
```

The script will ask you to select a test framework and a target platform for automation.

Currently, the only supported test framework is 'Robot Framework' and the only supported target platform is 'Web'. If you select any other options, the script will inform you that the selected option is not yet supported and will terminate.

## Future Enhancements

Support for 'Playwright' and 'Cypress' test frameworks, and 'Mobile', 'Desktop', and 'Mainframe' target platforms will be added in the future.
