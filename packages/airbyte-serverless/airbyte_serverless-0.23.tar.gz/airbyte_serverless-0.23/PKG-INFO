## üîçÔ∏è What is AirbyteServerless?

AirbyteServerless is a simple tool to **manage Airbyte connectors**, run them **locally** or deploy them in **serverless** mode.

<br>

## üí°  Why AirbyteServerless?

[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) is a must-have in your data-stack with its **catalog of open-source connectors to move your data from any source to your data-warehouse**.

To manage these connectors, Airbyte offers **Airbyte-Open-Source-Platform** which includes a server, workers, database, UI, orchestrator, connectors, secret manager, logs manager, etc.

AirbyteServerless aims at offering **a lightweight alternative** to Airbyte-Open-Source-Platform to simplify connectors management.

<br>

## üìù Comparing Airbyte-Open-Source-Platform & AirbyteServerless

| Airbyte-Open-Source-Platform    | AirbyteServerless |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Has a UI** | **Has NO UI**<br>Connections configurations are managed by documented yaml files |
| **Has a database**  | **Has NO database**<br>- Configurations files are versioned in git<br>- The destination stores the `state` (the [checkpoint](https://airbyte.com/blog/checkpointing) of where sync stops) and `logs` which can then be visualized with your preferred BI tool |
| **Has a transform layer**<br>Airbyte loads your data in a raw format but then enables you to perform basic transform such as replace, upsert, [schema normalization](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/basic-normalization/)   | **Has NO transform layer**<br>- Data is appended in your destination in raw format.<br>- `airbyte_serverless` is dedicated to do one thing and do it well: `Extract-Load`. |
| **NOT Serverless**<br>- Can be deployed on a VM or Kubernetes Cluster.<br>- The platform is made of tens of dependent containers that you CANNOT deploy with serverless  | **Serverless**<br>- An Airbyte source docker image is upgraded with a destination connector<br>- The upgraded docker image can then be deployed as an isolated `Cloud Run Job` (or `Cloud Run Service`)<br>- Cloud Run is natively monitored with metrics, dashboards, logs, error reporting, alerting, etc<br>- It can be scheduled or triggered by events  |
| **Is scalable with conditions**<br>Scalable if deployed on autoscaled Kubernetes Cluster and if you are skilled enough.<br>üëâ **Check that you are skilled enough with Kubernetes by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvEwPLcLcA)** üòÅ. | **Is scalable**<br>Each connector is deployed independently of each other. You can have as many as you want. |

## üí• Getting Started with `abs` CLI

`abs` is the CLI (command-line-interface) of AirbyteServerless which facilitates connectors management.

### Install `abs` üõ†Ô∏è

``` sh
pip install airbyte-serverless
```

### Create your first Connection üë®‚Äçüíª

``` sh
abs create my_first_connection --source="airbyte/source-faker:0.1.4" --destination="bigquery" --remote-runner "cloud_run_job"
```

> 1. Docker is required. Make sure you have it installed.
> 2. `source` param can be any Public Docker Airbyte Source ([here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=airbyte%2Fsource-) is the list). We recomend that you use faker source to get started.
> 3. `destination` param must be one of the following:
>     - `print` (default value if not set)
>     - `bigquery`
>     - *contributions are welcome to offer more destinations* ü§ó
> 4. `remote-runner` param must be `cloud_run_job`. More integrations will come in the future. This remote-runner is only used if you want to run the connection on a remote runner and schedule it.
> 5. The command will create a configuration file `./connections/my_first_connection.yaml` with initialized configuration.
> 6. Update this configuration file to suit your needs.


### Run it! ‚ö°

``` sh
abs run my_first_connection
```

> 1. This will launch an Extract-Load Job from the source to the destination.
> 2. The `run` commmand will only work if you have correctly edited `./connections/my_first_connection.yaml` configuration file.
> 3. If you chose `bigquery` destination, you must:
>    + have `gcloud` installed on your machine with default credentials initialized with the command `gcloud auth application-default login`.
>    + have correctly edited the `destination` section of `./connections/my_first_connection.yaml` configuration file. You must have `dataEditor` permission on the chosen BigQuery dataset.
> 4. Data is always appended at destination (not replaced nor upserted). It will be in raw format.
> 5. If the connector supports incremental extract (extract only new or recently modified data) then this mode is chosen.


### Select only some streams üßõüèº

You may not want to copy all the data that the source can get. To see all available `streams` run:

``` sh
abs list-available-streams my_first_connection
```

If you want to configure your connection with only some of these streams, run:

``` sh
abs set-streams my_first_connection "stream1,stream2"
```

Next `run` executions will extract selected streams only.


### Handle Secrets üîí

For security reasons, you do NOT want to store secrets such as api tokens in your yaml files. Instead, add your secrets in Google Secret Manager by following [this documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/create-secret-quickstart). Then you can add the secret resource name in the yaml file such as below:

```yaml
source:
  docker_image: "..."
  config:
    api_token: GCP_SECRET({SECRET_RESOURCE_NAME})
```

Replace `{SECRET_RESOURCE_NAME}` by your secret resource name which must have the format: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/secrets/{SECRET_ID}/versions/{SECRET_VERSION}`. To get this path:

1. Go to the [Secret Manager page](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager) in the Google Cloud console.
2. Go to the Secret Manager page
3. On the Secret Manager page, click on the Name of a secret.
4. On the Secret details page, in the Versions table, locate a secret version to access.
5. In the Actions column, click on the three dots.
6. Click on 'Copy Resource Name' from the menu.



### Run from the Remote Runner üöÄ

``` sh
abs remote-run my_first_connection
```
> 2. The `remote-run` commmand will only work if you have correctly edited `./connections/my_first_connection.yaml` configuration file including the `remote_runner` part.

> 1. This command will launch an Extract-Load Job like the `abs run` command. The main difference is that the command will be run on a remote deployed container (we use Cloud Run Job as the only container runner for now).
> 3. If you chose `bigquery` destination, the service account you put in `service_account` field of `remote_runner` section of the yaml must be `bigquery.dataEditor` on the target dataset and have permission to create some BigQuery jobs in the project.
> 4. If your yaml config contains some Google Secrets, the service account you put in `service_account` field of `remote_runner` section of the yaml must has read access to the secrets.


### Schedule the run from the Remote Runner ‚è±Ô∏è

``` sh
abs schedule-remote-run my_first_connection "0 * * * *"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET



### Get help üìô

``` sh
$ abs --help
Usage: abs [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create                  Create CONNECTION
  list                    List created connections
  list-available-streams  List available streams of CONNECTION
  remote-run              Run CONNECTION Extract-Load Job from remote runner
  run                     Run CONNECTION Extract-Load Job
  run-env-vars            Run Extract-Load Job configured by environment...
  set-streams             Set STREAMS to retrieve for CONNECTION (STREAMS...

- Open a PR! Below are some suggestions of work to be done:
  - implements a scheduler
  - implement the `get_logs` method of `BigQueryDestination`
  - enable updating cloud run job instead of deleting/creating when it already exists
  - add a new destination connector (Cloud Storage?)
  - add more remote runners such compute instances.
  - implements vpc access
  - implement optional post-processing (replace, upsert data at destination instead of append?)

## üèÜ Credits

- Big kudos to Airbyte for all the hard work on connectors!
- The generation of the sample connector configuration in yaml is heavily inspired from the code of `octavia` CLI developed by airbyte.
