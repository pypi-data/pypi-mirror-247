# Motiflets

This page was built in support of our paper "Discovering Leitmotifs in Multidimensional 
Time Series" by Patrick Sch√§fer and Ulf Leser.

Supporting Material
- `tests`: Please see the python tests for use cases
- `notebooks`: Please see the Jupyter Notebooks for use cases
- `csvs`: The results of the scalability experiments
- `motiflets`: Code implementing multidimensonal k-Motiflet
- `datasets`: Use cases in the paper

# Installation

The easiest is to use pip to install motiflets.

## a) Install using pip
```
pip install leitmotif
```

You can also install the project from source.

## b) Build from Source

First, download the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/patrickzib/motiflets.git
```

Change into the directory and build the package from source.
```
pip install .
```

# Usage

Here we illustrate how to use k-Motiflets.

# Use Cases

Data Sets: We collected challenging real-life data sets to assess the quality and 
scalability of MD algorithms. An overview of datasets can be found in Table 2 
of our paper.

- Jupyter-Notebook 
<a href="notebooks/use_cases_paper.ipynb">Univariate Use Cases for k-Motiflets</a>:
highlights all use cases used in the paper and shows the unique ability of k-Motiflets 
to learn its parameters from the data and find itneresting motif sets.
