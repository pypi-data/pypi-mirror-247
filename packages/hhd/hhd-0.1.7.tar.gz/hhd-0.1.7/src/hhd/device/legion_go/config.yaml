# Increases CPU utilisation, so disable if not needed.

# Button placement tweaks
# Swap legion places start and select on the legion keys
# True and l_is_select use the canonical order, like you would find on PS portal
# l_is_start considers Legion L to be the primary button

# Share button (mute button on DS5, Legion R, etc) to QAM (Guide + A)

# Touchpad modes
# The DS5 touchpad is too long, so it needs to be cropped.
# `stretch` resizes the square of the legion go to look like the DS5 touchpad
# Not recommended for controls, it causes distortion.
# "crop_center", "crop_start", "crop_end" make the legion go touchpad appear in
# the left, middle, and right of the DS5 touchpad. Remap the touchpad corresponding
# to the option you use in steam. With `crop_end` that would be the right touchpad.
# When you need access to the whole DS5 touchpad, e.g., for a PS5 native game,
# you can use "contain_start", "contain_center", "contain_end".
# These will place the whole touchpad of the DS5 in the top, middle, or bottom part
# of the legion go. `contain_start` feels best as it provides a boundary for your finger.
# ["stretch", "crop_center", "crop_start", "crop_end", "contain_start", "contain_end", "contain_center"]

# Enables led support through the DS5 controller.
# The configuration overrides profile 3 in the controlelrs.
# This is not the best fit for the controllers, so you can disable it here.

# Prints events to the console,
# consumes a lot of CPU and causes latency, do not leave enabled.
