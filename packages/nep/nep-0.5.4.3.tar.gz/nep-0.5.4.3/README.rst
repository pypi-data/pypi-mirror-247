==================

NEP+ is a *comprehensive* software platform (i.e., that provides a variety of functionalities) designed to facilitate the integration and design of interactive applications with both physical and digital agents.

NEP+ is a *holistic* software platform designed to empower users and developers with different backgrounds and preferences.

- Provides user-friendly interfaces that are accessible to end-users and advanced tools for experienced developers.
- Different research communities can adopt it, as interfaces and core libraries support different programming languages and operating systems.

The main functionality of NEP+ is to help and support in the design heterogeneous software architectures (i.e., complex applications composed of several modules developed over different programming languages, running on different operating systems, and performing different tasks).
