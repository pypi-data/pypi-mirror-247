## 🔧 Setting Up EvoX

Install `evox` effortlessly via `pip`:
```bash
pip install evox
```

**Note**: To install EvoX with JAX and hardware acceleration capabilities, please refer to our comprehensive [installation guide](https://evox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/install.html).


## 🚀 Dive Right In: Quick Start

Kickstart your journey with EvoX in just a few simple steps:
1. **Import necessary modules**:
```python
import evox
from evox import algorithms, problems, workflows
```
2. **Configure an algorithm and define a problem**:
```python
pso = algorithms.PSO(
    lb=jnp.full(shape=(2,), fill_value=-32),
    ub=jnp.full(shape=(2,), fill_value=32),
    pop_size=100,
)
ackley = problems.numerical.Ackley()
```
3. **Compose and initialize the workflow**:
```python
workflow = workflows.StdWorkflow(pso, ackley)
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
state = workflow.init(key)
```
4. **Run the workflow**:
```python
# Execute the workflow for 100 iterations
for i in range(100):
    state = workflow.step(state)
```
