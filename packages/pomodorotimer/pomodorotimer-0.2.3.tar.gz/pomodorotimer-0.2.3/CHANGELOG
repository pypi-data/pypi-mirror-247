Current versions
================

Version 0.2.3
-------------
- Added:

- Changed: 
    - sound.py:
        - Changed sound.py so that it does not play as a separate process, but connects as a user module to pomodorotimer.py.
        For this, libraries were used as new dependencies: sunddevice, numpy and scipy.
        - Renamed methods for more information: default_sound->play_default_sound, wav_sound->play_wav_sound.
    - pomodorotimer.py:
        - The global constant UP_CLEAR_STR has been replaced with the property self.clear_up_str.
        - The global constant min_str has been replaced with the property self.scale_progress. And delete separator '|'.
        - Different minor code changes

- Fixed: 
    - sound.py: 
      - the correct path to the sound.py file
      - Used os.path.abspath and os.path.join for more reliable operation with the paths to the sound file.
    - pomodorotimer.py: 
      - Proper processing of interruption by pressing Ctr+C.
      - Cleaning the console, before entering the pomodoro timer, was transferred to a separate method.

- Updated: Almost all project files and README

Older versions
==============

Version 0.2.2
-------------

- Updated: Almost all project files and README
- Changed: Pomodoro will work with python 3.10.13 or higher. This is due to updates to the dependencies of connected libraries.
- Fixed: 
    - setup.py: The os module is removed. Added pathlib, which provides platform-independent operations over the paths. Fixed dependencies.
    - requirements.txt - Fixed dependencies. Removed the now unused numpy library.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

- Added: Saving to a local SQLite3 database file and displaying statistics in a browser window
- Updated: Almost all project files and README
- Changed: Pomodoro Cycle progress bar colors changed

Version 0.1.2 (31.12.2019)
--------------------------

- Fixed a bug


Version 0.1.1 (31.12.2019)
--------------------------

- Updated: README
- Changed:
    In order to hide the output of debugging information of the audio
    player, we will transfer the playback/generation code of the audio
    to a separate file and we will call this script in the background.
    Why so? - because standard output redirection does not work due to
    the specifics of ffmpeg it self.
    The process itself is needed to play the WAV file or the generated sound.
- Fixed some bugs


Version 0.1.0 (30.12.2019)
--------------------------

+ First release. Basic functionality.
