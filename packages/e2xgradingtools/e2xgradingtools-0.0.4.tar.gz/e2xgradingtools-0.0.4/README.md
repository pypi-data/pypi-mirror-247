e2xgradingtools provides a structured approach to execute tests using the global namespace of Jupyter notebooks, with the following highlights:

- Convenient variable and function existence checks
- Continued execution of remaining tests even if one test fails
- Hiding of studentâ€™s print statements during test execution
- Built-in type checking for robust testing
- Ability to reference implementation for comparison testing
- Customizable to suit specific needs
- Test output can be parsed by e2xgrader for partial point extraction

Please consult the [docs](https://e2x-grading-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and look at the example notebook in this repository.
