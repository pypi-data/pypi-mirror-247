E2X Grading Tools Documentation
================================

``e2xgradingtools`` provides a structured approach to execute tests using the global namespace of Jupyter notebooks, with the following highlights:

* Convenient variable and function existence checks
* Continued execution of remaining tests even if one test fails
* Hiding of student's print statements during test execution
* Built-in type checking for robust testing
* Ability to reference implementation for comparison testing
* Customizable to suit specific needs
* Test output can be parsed by ``e2xgrader`` for partial point extraction
