    Find poster image on a :mod:`webdb <upsies.utils.webdbs>`, download it and

    attribute:

        ``finding_poster``
            Emitted before `webdb` is queried for a poster. Registered
            callbacks get the ID of the release.

        ``found_poster``
            Emitted after the poster was found. Registered callbacks get the URL
            to the poster image as a positional argument.

        ``downloading_poster``
            Emitted before the poster is downloaded. Registered callbacks get
            the URL to the poster image as a positional argument.

        ``downloaded_poster``
            Emitted after the poster was downloaded. Registered callbacks get
            the file path to the downloaded poster image as a positional
            argument.

        ``resizing_poster``
            Emitted before the poster is resized. Registered callbacks get the
            file path to the original poster image as a positional argument.

        ``resized_poster``
            Emitted after the poster was resized. Registered callbacks get the
            file path to the resized poster image as a positional argument.

        ``uploading_poster``
            Emitted before the poster is uploaded. Registered callbacks get the
            file path to the resized poster image as a positional argument.

        ``uploaded_poster``
            Emitted after the poster is uploaded. Registered callbacks get the
            URL to the resized poster image as a positional argument.
