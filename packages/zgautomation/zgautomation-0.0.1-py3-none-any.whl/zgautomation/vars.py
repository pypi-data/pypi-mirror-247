StaleElementReferenceException_text = """ 
Stale means the element no longer appears on the DOM of the page.


    Possible causes of StaleElementReferenceException include, but not limited to:
        * You are no longer on the same page, or the page may have refreshed since the element
          was located.
        * The element may have been removed and re-added to the screen, since it was located.
          Such as an element being relocated.
          This can happen typically with a javascript framework when values are updated and the
          node is rebuilt.
        * Element may have been inside an iframe or another context which was refreshed.
