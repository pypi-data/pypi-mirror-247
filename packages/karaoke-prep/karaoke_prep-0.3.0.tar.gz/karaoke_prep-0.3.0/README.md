# Karaoke Prep üé∂

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/karaoke-prep.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/karaoke-prep)

Prepare for karaoke video creation, by downloading audio from YouTube and lyrics from Genius for a given song.

This was created to make it easier for me to prepare the source audio, lyrics and instrumental audio so I can then do the actual karaoke creation in focus mode without internet.

## Features

- Audio Fetching: Automatically downloads audio in WAV format for the YouTube URL provided (or searches for the song/artist name and fetches the top result).
- Lyrics Fetching: Automatically fetches song lyrics from Genius.com using [LyricsGenius](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius).
- Audio Separation: Separates the downloaded audio into instrumental and vocal tracks, using [audio-separator](https://github.com/karaokenerds/python-audio-separator/).
- Multiple Audio Models: Runs audio separation with 2 different models (by default, `UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2` and `UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3`) to give you options for the backing track.
- Easy Configuration: Control the tool's behavior using command-line arguments.
- Organized Outputs: Creates structured output directories for easy access to generated tracks and lyrics.
- Internet First: Completes operations which require internet first, in case user is preparing last-minute before a period of being offline!

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/karaoke-prep.git
cd karaoke-prep
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username if you've forked the repository, or use the main repository URL if you have the permissions.

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```
poetry shell
```

### Running the Command-Line Interface Locally

You can run the CLI command directly within the virtual environment. For example:

Once you are done with your development work, you can exit the virtual environment by simply typing:

```
exit
```

### Building the Package

To build the package for distribution, use the following command:

```
poetry build
```

This will generate the distribution packages in the dist directory - but for now only @beveradb will be able to publish to PyPI.
