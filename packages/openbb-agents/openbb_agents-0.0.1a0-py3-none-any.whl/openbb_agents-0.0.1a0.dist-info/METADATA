# OpenBB-agents
Active work-in-progress. Consider pre-alpha for now.

This is a project that leverages LLMs and OpenBB Platform to create financial
analyst agents that can autonomously perform financial research, and answer
questions using up-to-date data. This is possible as a result of agents
utilizing function calling to interact with the OpenBB platform.


## Set-up
At present, we currently support Python 3.11. If you're using a earlier version
of Python, your mileage may vary. We'll be adding wider support very soon!

- Create a new virtual environment, with `poetry `
- `poetry install`

## Usage
Use the `run.py` script and pass in your query.

Queries can be simple:

``` sh
python run.py "What is the current market cap of TSLA?"
```

Queries can be complex:

``` sh
python run.py "Perform a fundamentals financial analysis of AMZN using the most recently available data. What do you find that's interesting?"
```

Queries can also have temporal dependencies (i.e the answers of previous subquestions are required to answer a later subquestion):

``` sh
python run.py "Who are TSLA's peers? What is their respective market cap? Return the results in _descending_ order of market cap."
```

There is more functionality coming very soon!

## Development

### Linting and Formatting
We're currently experimenting with `ruff` as a drop-in replacement for `black`, `isort` and `pylint`.

You can run linting checks as follows:

``` sh
ruff check
```

Or fix linting errors:

``` sh
ruff check --fix
```

Or format the code:

``` sh
ruff format
```

We've also included these in the `pre-commit`, if you'd prefer to have these checks run automatically before commiting code. 
You can install the `pre-commit` hooks as follows:

``` sh
pre-commit install
```

### Testing

We are in the process of adding tests.

We use `pytest` as our test-runner:

``` sh
pytest tests/
```
