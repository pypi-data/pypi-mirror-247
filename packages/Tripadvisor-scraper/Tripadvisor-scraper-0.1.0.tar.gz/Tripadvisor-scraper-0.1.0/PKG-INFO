[<u>Tripadvisor Scraper API</u>](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/web/tripadvisor) is an advanced web data extraction solution with an emphasis on scale, saved time, and instant results. The following introduces the basics of getting started with Tripadvisor Scraper API.

## How it works

You can provide us with any Tripadvisor URL, and we will return the results right away.

### Python input code example

The code example below shows an input code to be provided to the API.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal',
    'url': 'https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g60763-New_York_City_New_York.html',
    'user_agent_type': 'desktop',
    'geo_location': 'United States'
}

# Get a response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD'),
    json=payload
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with results.
pprint(response.json())
```
### Output example

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>...</script></body>
</html>
",
            "created_at": "2023-07-26 12:07:08",
            "job_id": "7089939195182992385",
            "page": 1,
            "status_code": 200,
            "updated_at": "2023-07-26 12:07:41",
            "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g60763-New_York_City_New_York.html"
        }
    ]
}
