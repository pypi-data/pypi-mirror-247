# youtube-livechat-scraper
A tool to scrape youtube livechat data I came up with while watching vtubers. It rips almost all data from a VOD's livechat including the following:
- Chat messages
- Superchats
- Memberships joined
- Memberships gifted and received
- Purchased Stickers

All of the data can be wrapped up in a large raw JSON object that also contains lots of metadata from the responses, like the author, the time the message got sent, etc.

## USAGE:

Requires the following python3 packages:
  - NOTE: These packages will be installed via pip when installing the scraper.
  - BeautifulSoup
  - Requests

How to use:
  - Import the LiveChatScraper from scrapers.liveChatScraper to wherever you want to make the scraping call.
  - Find a VOD URL and copy it
  - Create a LiveChatScraper object and pass in the VOD's URL.
  - Call the scrape() method on the created scraper object and the scrape will run.
  - Once the scrape is completed, you can call ouputMessages() to get a dictionary with all the scraped data.
  - You can all save the scraped data as a JSON to a fill by calling the writeToFile method passing the OUTPUT_JSON constant

* example.py has a working example which saves the data to different formats
