**Aspose.OCR.Models.Handwritten for Python via .NET** This extension to Aspose.OCR for Python via.NET adds a recognition model and associated methods designed for extracting handwritten text from images. It supports a number of European languages based on Extended Lain alphabet. 
Handwritten recognition has various business, government and personal applications:

- Extract text from handwritten notes and letters.
- Convert handwritten historical records and documents into digital formats for archival purposes.
- Parse resumes and employee records.
- Analyze information from handwritten inventory lists to maintain accurate and up-to-date databases.
- Analyze handwritten customer feedback and reviews to gain insights into customer preferences.
- And many more.

Important considerations:

- This package requires Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET to function properly. It cannot be used separately from the core API.
- The model only works with Extended Latin letters and numbers. Check Aspose.OCR for .NET documentation (https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/python-net/) for more details.


## Get Started

Run ```pip install aspose-ocr-python-net``` and ```pip install aspose-ocr-models-handwritten-python-net``` to fetch the package. If you already have **Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** and want to get the latest version, please run ```pip install --upgrade aspose-ocr-python-net```.

To learn more about **Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** and explore the basic requirements and features of the library, check out the following [Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/python-net/) pages for other use cases.

### Code snippet

**Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** is extremely easy to use, regardless of the application's scale and complexity. Let's try to create a very simple application that can extract text from images and output it to the console.

1. Install  the latest version of the *aspose-ocr* package using pip.
2. Import `aspose.ocr` module into the application.
3. Create an instance of `AsposeOcr` class.
4. Create an instance of `OcrInput` class and add one or more images to it.
5. Extract text from the image with handwritten text using `recognize_handwritten_text` method.
6. Output the extracted text to the console.

Full code:

```python
import aspose.ocr as ocr

# Initialize OCR engine
api = AsposeOcr()

# Initialize OCR input
input = OcrInput(InputType.SINGLE_IMAGE)
input.add("1.png")
input.add("2.jpg")

# Recognize images
result = api.recognize_handwritten_text(input)

# Print result
print(result[0].recognition_text)
print(result[1].recognition_text)
```
