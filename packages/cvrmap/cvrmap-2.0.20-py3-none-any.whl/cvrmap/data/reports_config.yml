      datatype: figures
      suffix: boldmean
      extension: [.svg]
    caption: This graph shows the estimated <em>etCO<sub>2</sub></em> (in mmHg) and the global BOLD signal (arbitrary units).

  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, suffix: delay}
    extension: [.svg]
    caption: Estimated delays (seconds), with the convention that zero delay corresponds to <em>etCO<sub>2</sub></em> synchronized with global BOLD signal.
