# pyproject.toml for `nighthawk` pip package.
#
# To create a Python environment named `nighthawk-dev` in which to work
# on the `nighthawk` package:
#
#     conda create -n nighthawk-dev python=3.10
#     conda activate nighthawk-dev
#     pip install -e <nighthawk package dir path>
#     pip install build twine
#
# To build the `nighthawk` package, issue the following commands from
# within the directory containing this file:
#
#     conda activate nighthawk-dev
#     python -m build
#
# The build process will write package `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files to the
# `dist` subdirectory of the directory containing this file.
#
# To upload a built package to the test Python package index:
#
#     conda activate nighthawk-dev
#     python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
#     python -m twine upload --repository nighthawk-test dist/* --verbose
#
# To upload a built package to the real Python package index:
#
#     conda activate nighthawk-dev
#     python -m twine upload --repository nighthawk-prod dist/* --verbose
#     python -m twine upload dist/*
#
# Release checklist:
#
#     0. Test, test, test!
#
#     1. Update package version number below. Commit and push to GitHub repo.
#
#     2. Tag Git commit with version number. From the directory containing
#        this file, do something like (but with the correct version number):
#
#            git tag v0.1.0               # creates tag in local repo
#            git push origin v0.1.0       # pushes tag to GitHub repo
#
#        If for some reason you wind up wanting to move the tag to a
#        different commit (you probably will some day):
#
#            git tag -d v0.1.0            # deletes tag from local repo
#            git push origin :v0.1.0      # pushes tag deletion to GitHub repo
#
#     3. Build package (see commands above).
#
#     4. Upload package to PyPI test (see commands above).
#
#     5. Sanity check installation and execution. Use the following command in a 
#		 fresh environment to install from the test repository. The extra-index-url
#		 argument looks in test.pypi.org but also allows pip to look outside too,
#		 for installing dependencies.
#
#			pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nighthawk==0.1.0
#
#     6. Upload package to PyPI prod (see commands above).	
#
#     7. Create release in GitHub. Choose the tag created above for the
#        release. Give the release the same name as the tag. Write
#        release notes.
#
#     8. Update documentation if needed, including with new version
#        number. (BVD: should this be done before uploading the package,
#		 so the README contains the correct version number?)
#
#     9. Announce.
