Monalysa, _aka_ <u>**Mo**</u>ovement a<u>**nalys**</u>is libr<u>**a**</u>y, is a unified python library for the quantitative analysis of sensorimotor behavior. Monalysa provides a set of data structures, functions, and classes for representing, analyzing, and visualizing movement-related data from different technologies (motion capture, inertial measurement units, robots, force/torque sensors, force plates, etc.).

## Purpose of the library
In the spirit of open science, the monalysa library provides open-source code for a set of commonly used methods, measures, and tools for analyzing movement data. Such a library would be a step towards the standardization of procedures used for movement analysis.

## Who is this library for?
This library is aimed at students, researchers, clinicians and industry professionals working with movement data.

## Features
Collection of supported sub-packages and modules:
    - Movement quality
    - Upper-Limb functioning
    - IMU data processing
    - Movement generation
