pipx install pywal
```

### Arch Linux

- [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kde-material-you-colors) use your preferred AUR helper

### Optional features

- Install the [pywal](https://pypi.org/project/pywal/) python module to theme other programs using Material You Colors
  - Check [pywal Customization Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization) to theme supported programs

# Running from terminal to debug your configuration

- Run `kde-material-you-colors`

- Flags take precedence over configuration file, run `kde-material-you-colors -h` to see the list of available options

## Starting/Stopping Desktop entries

**If not installed by your package manager**, run `kde-material-you-colors -cl` to copy desktop entries to ~/.local/share/applications/

- To start the program launch **KDE Material You Colors** from your applications list
- To stop it launch **Stop KDE Material You Colors** from your applications list

# Running on Startup

After finishing the setup, you can make it run automatically on boot

1. Copy the default configuration to ~/.config/kde-material-you-colors/config.conf:

    `kde-material-you-colors -c`

2. Set the program to automatically start with Plasma:

    `kde-material-you-colors -a`

3. Reboot or logout/login and test the changes

## Removing from autostart

1. Open `System Settings` > `Startup and Shutdown`
2. Remove `kde-material-you-colors` by clicking on the `-` button.

# Configuration file

- Copy default configuration: run `kde-material-you-colors -c`
- Edit ~/.config/kde-material-you-colors/config.conf
- Run `kde-material-you-colors` with no arguments from terminal to test it.
- **You can view the sample configuration file [here](https://github.com/luisbocanegra/kde-material-you-colors/blob/main/src/kde_material_you_colors/data/sample_config.conf)**

# Notes

- To update color with `plasma-apply-colorscheme` (utility provided by plasma developers), the file containing the new color scheme must have a different name than the current one, to workaround this the program creates two scheme files with different names, then applies one after the other. As a result you end up with duplicated color schemes and maybe some lag while updating schemes.

- The wallpaper is obtained in the following order:

  - First, uses the [Plasma Desktop Scripting API](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/scripting/api/) to read Wallpaper plugin configuration.

  - If the previous fails it uses the [KWin Scripting API](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/api/) and [KWin's Screenshot plugin](https://github.com/KDE/kwin/tree/master/src/plugins/screenshot) to take a Screenshot of the Desktop view
