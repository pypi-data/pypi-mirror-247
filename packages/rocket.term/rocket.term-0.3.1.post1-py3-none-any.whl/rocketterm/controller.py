    The Controller holds all the program state that is independent of the
    graphical display to the user. It performs lazy caching of information
    that is retrieved via the RC APIs. The Screen and Parser application logic
    should mostly use the Controller for interacting with the RC server. For
    some simple cases they may also directly use the Comm interface to do so.

    The Controller receives asynchronous notifications via the Comm interface
    and calls back into the actual application class (Screen in our case) to
    provide pre processed, more abstract information about events.
