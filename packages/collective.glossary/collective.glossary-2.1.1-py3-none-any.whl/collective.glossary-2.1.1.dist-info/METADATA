===================
collective.glossary
===================

**collective.glossary** is a Plone backend add-on to define a glossary and provide tooltips on matching text.

- The terms are defined as title / definition pairs.
- The term can have variants.
- The definiton is richtext formated.
- The tooltip can be disabled in glossary control panel.
- Tooltips can be restricted to a selection of content types.

The add-on provides a REST API service @glossary_terms to fetch the terms of the glossary.

`@rohberg/volto-slate-glossary <https://github.com/rohberg/volto-slate-glossary>`_ is the corresponding Volto add-on.
