# Toyota Connected Services Europe Python module

### [!] **This is still in beta**

### [!] **Only EU is supported, other regions are not possible so far. See [this](https://github.com/widewing/toyota-na) for North America**

## Description

Python 3 package to communicate with [Toyota Connected Europe](https://www.toyota-europe.com/about-us/toyota-in-europe/toyota-connected-europe) Services.
This is an unofficial package and Toyota can change their API at any point without warning.

## Installation

This package can be installed through `pip`.

```text
pip install mytoyota
```

## Usage

```python
import json
import asyncio
from mytoyota.client import MyT

username = "jane@doe.com"
password = "MyPassword"
brand = "toyota"  # or lexus

# Get supported regions, can be passed to the optional 'region' argument of MyT
# At this moment, only the 'europe' region is supported
print(MyT.get_supported_regions())

client = MyT(username=username, password=password, brand=brand)

async def get_information():
    print("Logging in...")
    await client.login()

    print("Retrieving cars...")
    # Returns cars registered to your account + information about each car.
    cars = await client.get_vehicles()

    for car in cars:

        # Returns live data from car/last time you used it as an object.
        vehicle = await client.get_vehicle_status(car)

        # You can either get them all async (Recommended) or sync (Look further down).
        data = await asyncio.gather(
            *[
                client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin, interval="day"),
                client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin, interval="isoweek"),
                client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin),
                client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin, interval="year"),
            ]
        )

        # You can access odometer data like this:
        mileage = vehicle.dashboard.odometer
        # Or retrieve the energy level (electric or gasoline)
        fuel = vehicle.dashboard.fuel_level
        battery = vehicle.dashboard.battery_level
        # Or Parking information:
        latitude = vehicle.parkinglocation.latitude

        # Daily stats
        daily_stats = await client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin, interval="day")

        # ISO 8601 week stats
        iso_weekly_stats = await client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin, interval="isoweek")

        # Monthly stats is returned by default
        monthly_stats = await client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin)

        # Get year to date stats.
        yearly_stats = await client.get_driving_statistics(vehicle.vin, interval="year")


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(get_information())
loop.close()

```

## Known issues

- Statistical endpoint will return `None` if no trip have been performed in the requested timeframe. This problem will often happen at the start of each week, month or year. Also daily stats will of course also be unavailable if no trip have been performed.

Coming soon...
