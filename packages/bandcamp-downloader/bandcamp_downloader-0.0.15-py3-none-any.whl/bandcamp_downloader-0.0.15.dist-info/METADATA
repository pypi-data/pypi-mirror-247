Bugs
----

Bugs should be reported `here <https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/issues>`_.
Please include the URL and/or options used as well as the output when using the `--debug` option.

For discussions, join us in `Discord <https://discord.gg/nwdT4MP>`_.

When you submit a request, please re-read it once to avoid a couple of
mistakes (you can and should use this as a checklist):

Are you using the latest version?
---------------------------------

This should report that you're up-to-date. About 20% of the reports we
receive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions. This
goes for feature requests as well.

Is the issue already documented?
--------------------------------

Make sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to
open. Search at the top of the window or at
`Issues <https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/search?type=Issues>`_.
If there is an issue, feel free to write something along the lines of
"This affects me as well, with version 2015.01.01. Here is some more
information on the issue: ...". While some issues may be old, a new post
into them often spurs rapid activity.

Why are existing options not enough?
------------------------------------

Before requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at `the list
of supported
options <https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/blob/master/README.rst#synopsis>`_.
Many feature requests are for features that actually exist already!
Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detail
how the existing similar options do *not* solve your problem.

Does the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?
---------------------------------------------------------

Some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or
should open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. While
it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one
ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot
mark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leads
to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth,
until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.

Is anyone going to need the feature?
------------------------------------

Only post features that you (or an incapable friend you can
personally talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem like
a good idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested by
someone who requires them.

Is your question about bandcamp-dl?
-----------------------------------

It may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completely
unrelated to bandcamp-dl and relate to a different or even the
reporter's own application. Please make sure that you are actually using
bandcamp-dl. If you are using a UI for bandcamp-dl, report the bug to
the maintainer of the actual application providing the UI. On the other
hand, if your UI for bandcamp-dl fails in some way you believe is
related to bandcamp-dl, by all means, go ahead and report the bug.
