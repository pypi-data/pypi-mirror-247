This package provides SLEQP, an open-source solver for large-scale nonlinear continuous optimization. SLEQP is available as a callable library with interfaces to C, Python, AMPL, and MATLAB / Octave. It uses an active set method based on a combination of successive linear programming and equality constrained quadratic programming.
