The project is currently configured to make use of [Hatchling](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) for dependency management. 
Take a look at the web site to see how best to install the tool.
Once you have checked out the project, you can install the project for development using the following command:

```bash
hatch env create all.py3.11
```

Then you can find the location of the installation using:

```bash
hatch env find all.py3.11
```

For users of CLion / PyCharm, you can then add the environment by selecting an existing virtual environment using
