# CDO Local UUID Utility

This project provides a specialized UUID-generating function that can, on user request, cause a program to generate deterministic UUIDs.  Its main purpose is to assist with generating version-controllable example data using consistent identifiers.  This package intentionally includes mechanisms to make it difficult to activate this non-random mode without awareness of the caller.

Full documentation is available at the [project homepage](https://github.com/Cyber-Domain-Ontology/CDO-Utility-Local-UUID).
