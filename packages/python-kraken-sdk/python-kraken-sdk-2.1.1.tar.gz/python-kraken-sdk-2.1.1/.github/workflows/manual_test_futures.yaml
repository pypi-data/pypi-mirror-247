# NOTE: This workflow is intended to be used manually for example on fork
#       branches to validate that all Futures REST and websocket unit tests
#       run through successfully.
#
#       This is required in PR when changes were made that (could) affect
#       the Futures related code parts.
#
#       To run this action the following secrets must be set in the forked
#       repository:
#         * FUTURES_API_KEY
#         * FUTURES_SECRET_KEY
#         * FUTURES_SANDBOX_KEY
#         * FUTURES_SANDBOX_SECRET
#
#       ... see the README for information about how to generate Futures API
#       keys for the live and demo/sandbox environment. Please also make sure
#       to set the "Read Only" permission for the live account to not risk any
#       funds during testing! The demo account requires full permissions.
