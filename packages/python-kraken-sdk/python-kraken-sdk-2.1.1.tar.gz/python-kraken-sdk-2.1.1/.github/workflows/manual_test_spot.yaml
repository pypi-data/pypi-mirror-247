# NOTE: This workflow is intended to be used manually for example on fork
#       branches to validate that all Spot REST and websocket unit tests
#       run through successfully.
#
#       This is required in PR when changes were made that (could) affect
#       the Spot related code parts.
#
#       To run this action the following secrets must be set in the forked
#       repository:
#         * SPOT_API_KEY
#         * SPOT_SECRET_KEY
#
#       ... see the README for information about how to generate Spot API keys.
#       Please also make sure to enable the following API permissions:
#         * Query funds
#         * Deposit funds
#         * Query open orders & trades
#         * Query closed orders & trades
#         * Query ledger entries
#         * Export data
#         * Access WebSockets API
#
#       Disable all other permissions since we don't want to create or cancel
#       real orders or withdraw funds during testing. These tests are disabled
#       by default but having the permissions disabled is the safest way of
#       testing.
