# Self review checklist âœ…

Before creating a pull request you should check the following requirements that
must be addressed before a PR will be accepted.

- [ ] **All** pre-commit hooks must run through - successfully.
- [ ] Make sure that the changes confirm the coding style of the
      [python-kraken-sdk](https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-kraken-sdk). Most
      issues will be resolve through the pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] Also take care to follow the community guidelines and the [Code of
      Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- [ ] Self-review your changes to detect typos, syntax errors and any kind of
      unwanted behavior.
- [ ] If you changed the source code you have to **ensure that all unit tests
      run through**. If you added a new function you also have to **write a test**
      for that. Also make sure to **follow the doc string style** of the package and
      **provide at least one working example** within a function doc string. This is
      important since doc strings will be reflected within the documentation.
- [ ] Take your time to prepare your code before creating a PR. A good PR will
      save a lot of time for everyone.
- [ ] There are several workflows/actions within this repository. Any relevant
      workflow must be run successfully within your fork. In the following these
      workflows are listed, but **please also read the respective workflow files to
      get further information**.
  - PR Manual Pre-Commit (`manual_pre_commit.yaml`): This workflow must be green
    in any case.
  - PR Manual Build (`manual_build.yaml`): Must be green in any case.
  - PR Manual CodeQL (`manual_codeql.yaml`): same here
  - PR Manual Test Spot (`manual_test_spot.yaml`): If any Spot related change
    happened
  - PR Manual Test Futures (`manual_test_futures.yaml`): For any Futures related
    changes
  - CI/CD (`cicd.yaml`): Can be used to run all actions at once - but requires
    having API keys for Spot, Futures and the Futures demo environment.
