# Battleship TUI
Battleship TUI is an implementation of the popular paper-and-pen Battleship game for 
your terminal. You can play against the AI or a real player via the Internet, 
customize game options and appearance, keep track of your achievements, and more.

## Features
* Singleplayer mode  
* Multiplayer mode (via Internet)
* Customizable game rules
* Game statistics

## Planned features
* Customizable UI 
* Ranking system
* Account management
* Better CLI

## Requirements
* A terminal (Windows PowerShell is fine too, see below)
* Python 3.10 or higher

> [!NOTE]
> If you're on Windows, **make sure** to install [the newer Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US). 
> The older Windows PowerShell can't properly display some symbols. 

## Installation
The recommended way to install and update the game is via 
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (especially if you don't know anything about 
virtual environments).

```shell
pipx install battleship-tui[client]
```

`battleship-tui` is merely a Python package and is distributed via PyPI. You can 
install it via `pip` too, but make sure it installs into a venv so that you're not 
messing with the system interpreter.

```shell
# Linux example.
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install battleship-tui[client]
```

## Play
Once the game is installed you can use the `battleship` command to run it. This 
command will launch the user interface and present you with the main menu.

### Play via CLI
You can launch the game via CLI subcommands too, especially if you want to skip some 
in-game menus.

For example, if your favorite game mode is singleplayer, salvo variant, you can 
quickly get into battle by running `battleship play single --salvo`.

Run `battleship play --help` to discover available options.

## Multiplayer
You can play Battleship TUI with your friends or colleagues via the Internet. Choose 
**Multiplayer** option in the main menu to do this.

### Game account
You may sign up for a multiplayer account or try multiplayer with guest access.

To sign up, run `battleship account signup`. You'll be prompted with your email, 
desired nickname, and a password. Your nickname will be displayed in-game. It should 
contain 7 to 20 characters and be unique. Your password should contain at least 9 
characters.

> [!NOTE]
> Guests given an autogenerated nickname, their game statistics isn't saved. Guest 
> access will work until you log off.
