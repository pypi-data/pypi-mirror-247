jinns
=====

Physics Informed Neural Networks with JAX. **jinns** has been developed to estimate solutions to your ODE et PDE problems using neural networks.
**jinns** is built on JAX.

**jinns** specific points:

- **jinns** is coded with JAX as a backend: forward and backward autodiff, vmapping, jitting and more!

- We focus the development towards inverse problems and inference in mecanistic-statistical models

- [Separable PINNs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dEySGIcDnI) are implemented

- Check out our various notebooks to get started with `jinns`
